    (ii) notify the applicant of the state of the misconduct allegation;

    2. if another misconduct allegation against the respondent is already being dealt with by
    another Sub-Panel—in writing assign the allegation to that Sub-Panel unless doing so

89. ## Decision by Sub-Panel

    3. While a misconduct allegation is under consideration:


    1. the Sub-Panel may, in writing:

    or position; and
    (iii) direct a member to truthfully answer its questions in person or in writing;

    (ii) found to have been substantiated under clauses89. .13(d), 5. or (f);

    11. may reopen any of the previous allegations to which sub-clause 10refers that it decides
    may form part of a repeated behaviour;

    12. may take over from another Sub-Panel the allegation of another applicant made against the

    1. give the respondent:
    9. notice in writing of the substance of the relevant part of the allegation;

    (ii) notice in writing of information adverse to the respondent that is credible, relevant
    and significant to the decision to be made; and
    (iii) a reasonable opportunity to make an oral and written submission to the Sub-Panel
    regarding the relevant part of the allegation and what sanction should be imposed if it
    is substantiated; and
    2. consider any such submission.

    11. The information described in clauses89. .10(a)9. and (ii) must only include the name of or other
    identifying information about any person if:
    1. it is strictly necessary in order to comply with those clauses; and
    2. the person whose name or other identifying information is to be included gives their
    express consent in writing.

    12. If a Sub-Panel cannot comply with clauses89. .10(a)9. and (ii) because a person will not give
    consent under clause 89.11(b), the relevant part of the allegation must be dismissed under
    clause 89.13(a)(iv).

    13. Subject to clause 89.14, regarding the whole or each part of the misconduct allegation, the Sub-

    9. it concerned an act or acts alleged to have occurred more than18. 0 days before it was
    made;

    (ii) the information given under clause 87.13. was too long, insufficient or vague;

    (iv) the Sub-Panel was not able to afford the respondent procedural fairness in dealing
    with it;

    2. dismissed without determination because, even if it was substantiated:
    9. it would not amount to misconduct; or
    (ii) it is not serious enough to warrant a sanction;

    3. dismissed because it was not found to be substantiated;

    4. found to be substantiated and the member is not sanctioned;

    5. found to be substantiated and the member is censured; or
    6. found to be substantiated and recommend a sanction to State Council.

    14. If the respondent is a member who holds public office at the time the Sub-Panel comes to make
    its decision, clause 89.135. is not available as a decision.

    15. A misconduct allegation (or part of it) dismissed under clause 89.13(a)(ii) is reinstated before the
    same Sub-Panel if, within60.  days of it having been dismissed, the applicant gives a member of
    the Misconduct Panel notice in writing of the information required under clause 87.1(c).

    16. A misconduct allegation (or part of it) dismissed under clause 89.13(a)(iv) is reinstated before
    the same Sub-Panel if, within60.  days of it having been dismissed, the person whose name or
    other identifying information was to be included gives a member of the Misconduct Panel their
    express consent in writing under clause 89.11(b).

    17. A member of the Sub-Panel may make a misconduct allegation:


    1. against a member for breaching a direction given or suspension imposed by the Sub-Panel
    under clause 89.3(a);

    2. if the Sub-Panel dismisses a misconduct allegation (or part of it) under clauses89. .132. or
