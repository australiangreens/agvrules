<summary>Drafting Panel commentary</summary>

<u>At a glance</u>

* Sets out our purposes (clause 1).

* Sets out our principles about (clause 2 to 7):

    * how we make policies and the party strategy,

    * members in public office,

    * how we make decisions,

    * the openness of our Party, and

    * affirmative action.

* Sets out the hierarchy of policies (including Australian Greens policies and local
  policies made by branches) (clause 2).

<u>Summary and Explanation</u>

Clause 1 on purposes is straightforward.

Clause 2 on policy requires that party policy and the party strategy generally only be
made by members through a participatory process, by consensus (or a 75% vote) of
members participating. State Council can make a policy or the party strategy in urgent
circumstances. The clause also reflects our existing hierarchy of national, state and
local policies.

Clause 3 is about members in public office and keeps the existing arrangements. It
retains the conscience vote, requires members in public office at a particular level to
attempt to reach consensus with each other, and requires members in public office to
engage with branches and other party bodies wanting such engagement.

Clause 4 introduces a new requirement that all decisions must be made in pursuit of
the party’s purposes (clause 4(1)). The clause sets out, in a more mandatory way than
in our current Constitution, the principles of consensus decision-making (clause 4(2) &
(4)). This clause also sets out new principles for the delegation of decision-making
(clause 4(3)).

Clause 5 sets out the entitlement of members to attend meetings, establishes a new
requirement that meetings be accessible to all members and that members have a
reasonable right to communicate with all other members. This clause also provides for
members’ forums to be held twice a year to discuss issues raised by members
(clause 5(4)).

Clause 6 establishes an additional strengthened mandatory obligation on the Party to
implement affirmative action measures for underrepresented groups. However, this
does not affect the election process for the State Council.

1. ## Purposes

    <details><summary>Drafting Panel commentary</summary>
    Clause 1 on purposes is straightforward.
    </details>

    The purposes of the Party are:

    <subclause-letters>

    1.  to further a vision of the world characterised by peace, social
    justice, grassroots participatory democracy and ecological
    sustainability;

    2.  to make policies that are consistent with the Charter;

    3.  to win support for its policies;

    4.  to see its policies implemented;

    5.  to have its members elected to public office;

    6.  to be a member body of the Australian Greens; and

2. ## Policies and party strategy

    <details><summary>Drafting Panel commentary</summary>
    Clause 2 on policy requires that party policy and the party strategy generally only be made by members through a participatory process, by consensus (or a 75% vote) of members participating. State Council can make a policy or the party strategy in urgent circumstances. The clause also reflects our existing hierarchy of national, state and local policies.

    1.  Each state policy and the party strategy may only be made,

        members who hold public office.

    2.  A proposal to make, amend or repeal a state policy or the party
        strategy that is put to a vote is passed if at least 75% of the
        members in attendance who vote on the proposal vote in favour
        and State Council ratifies it.

    3.  If State Council does not ratify such a proposal at its next
        meeting, it must reopen the process that led to it.

    4.  State Council may make, amend or repeal a state policy or the
        party strategy in urgent circumstances. 

    5.  The policies of the Party are:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  the policies made by the Australian Greens (***national
            policies***);

        2.  the policies made by the Party except local policies
            (***state policies***); and

        3.  the policies made by branches (***local policies***).

        </subclause-letters>

    6.  State policies must be consistent with national policies.

    7.  Local policies must be consistent with state and national
        policies.

    8.  Each local policy must apply only within the branch area of the
        branch that makes it.

3. ## Public office

    <details><summary>Drafting Panel commentary</summary>

    2.  The Party may only give such endorsement or permission to a
        member.

    3.  The preselection of a candidate for public office in an
        electorate must, unless circumstances justify otherwise, be done

        1.  for an electorate other than a local government ward—that
            electorate; and

        </subclause-letters>

    4.  The eligibility requirements to vote in a preselection are in
        Schedule 7.

    5.  Each member who holds public office must advocate and vote for
        the implementation of the policies of the Party, except that, if
        they have a conscientious objection to a policy, they may vote
        in accordance with their conscience.

    6.  Where there are two or more members who hold public office in a
        particular council or parliament, they must make every effort to
        reach consensus on each substantive matter before them.

    7.  Each member who holds public office must, to a reasonable
        extent, engage with:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  each branch whose branch area overlaps with their
            electorate; and

        2.  any party body that seeks their engagement.

        </subclause-letters>

4. ## Decision-making

    <details><summary>Drafting Panel commentary</summary>

    Clause 4 introduces a new requirement that all decisions must be made in pursuit of
    the party’s purposes (clause 4(1)). The clause sets out, in a more mandatory way than
    in our current Constitution, the principles of consensus decision-making (clause 4(2) &

            consensus and in a spirit of collaboration and collective

        2.  meaningful participation should be fostered by all
            participants;

        3.  the expression of diverse views should be encouraged;

        4.  enough time should be devoted to allow sufficient

        1.  the meaningful participation of members is valuable for its
            own sake;

        2.  a decision with local effects should be made at the local
            level;

        3.  decisions should be high-quality, strategic and effective;
            and

        4.  decisions should be made efficiently.

        </subclause-letters>

    4.  A substantive proposal may only be put to a vote if every effort
        has been made to reach consensus and the decision should not be
        deferred.

            proposal; or
