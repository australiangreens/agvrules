<summary>Drafting Panel commentary</summary>

See box under [Part 3](./03-state-council.md).

The election of State Councillors is overseen by an independent Constitutional Votes
Committee, which is dealt with in [Part 4](./04-constitutional-votes-committee.md). The Constitutional Votes Committee must
conduct the election under important principles set out in Schedule 6, [item 4](#4), including
prevention of unfair influence, equal treatment of candidates and informed voting.

Schedule 6, [item 5](#election-rules), requires the Constitutional Votes Committee to establish rules for
the conduct of the election following the principles and procedures set out in detail in
item 4.

Schedule 6, [items 3 and 4](#by-elections), set out that by-elections may only occur if there are 3 or
more casual vacancies. Otherwise (and thus usually) a vacancy is added to the
vacancies to be filled at the next scheduled (i.e. annual) election, with a procedure to
determine which candidates fill the full two-year terms and which fill a shorter term.

[Schedule 7](./schedule-07-eligibility-requirements.md) sets out the requirements to be elected to State Council, the most
significant of which is to have been a member of the party for at least two years, to be a
current resident of Victoria, and not to have been in the past year a member who holds
public office. There are limitations also on staff of the Party or of a member who holds
public office being elected ([Schedule 7, Item 4](./schedule-07-eligibility-requirements.md#state-councillor)) and some other limitations. State
Councillors are limited to two terms before effectively needing to take a one year break
([Schedule 7, item 4(3)(a)](./schedule-07-eligibility-requirements.md#4.3.a)).

For the system for electing the State Council, see [Part 3](./03-state-council.md) above.

            election, employ a system under which the votes are
            first counted to determine who is elected, and are then

            candidates are elected to which offices, from the
            longest term to the shortest;

        13. employ a system under which candidates are eliminated

            that would have resulted in more than three State
            Councillors being members of the same branch;

            and

    3.  The resources of the Party and those at the disposal of a
        member who holds public office must not be used to support
        one candidate against another.

5. ## Election rules

    1.  Before each election, the Committee must make, and make
        available to members, rules for that election (***election
        rules***) that provide for the practical implementation of
        the principles in item 4(1), the requirements in item ​4(2)
        and the rule in item 4(3).

    2.  Before doing that, the Committee must:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  make a draft of the election rules available to members;
            and

        2.  allow members a reasonable opportunity to comment on
            them.

        </subclause-letters>

    3.  The election rules may provide that:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  certain modes of campaigning are prohibited;

        2.  candidates must be assisted by the Party to contact each
            member; and

        3.  election deliberation sessions must be conducted in a
            certain way.

        </subclause-letters>

    4.  The Committee may:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  make rulings about whether the election rules have been
            breached;

        2.  require a candidate who has breached the election rules
            to remedy that breach; and

        3.  cancel the candidacy of a candidate who seriously
            breaches the election rules or a ruling of the
            Committee.

        </subclause-letters>

6. ## Election deliberation session

    1.  In this Constitution, ***election deliberation session***
        means a discussion of:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  the issues facing the Party and how they should be
            addressed;

        2.  the strengths and weaknesses of the current State
            Council; and

        3.  the merits of the candidates in addressing those.

        </subclause-letters>

    2.  For each election, before the roll of eligible voters is
        closed:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  each branch must hold at least one election deliberation
            session; and

        2.  the Committee must hold at least five election
            deliberation sessions.

        </subclause-letters>

    3.  Each candidate may only attend one deliberation session but
        must not participate in the discussion.

    4.  The failure of a branch to hold an election deliberation
        session does not, alone, invalidate an election.
