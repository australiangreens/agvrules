<u>At a glance</u>

* Provides for general meetings under the Act, including the annual general
  meeting.

* Sets out a list of other things that are helpful or required by the Act.

<u>Summary and Explanation</u>

The ‘general meeting’ is a meeting of all members as required by law. In particular, it is
the body that considers special resolutions, including those to change the Constitution
of the Party.

The quorum of the general meeting to start and continue is reduced from
100 to 50, but for a special resolution to pass (e.g. to change the Constitution) it retains
the rule that 100 members must vote along with the legislatively required 75% in
favour.

The only resolutions general meetings are empowered to pass are special
resolutions.
