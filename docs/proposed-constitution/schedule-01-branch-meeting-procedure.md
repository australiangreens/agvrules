Schedule 1 sets out the meeting procedure for Branches.

The quorum for Branches with less than 15 members is set at 4.

Branches can set their own procedures but State Council has the power to revoke
branch-decided procedures in exceptional circumstances (e.g. if a branch decided that
a branch office bearer would have an unlimited term).

</details>

1. ## Convening

    A branch meeting may be convened:

    1.  in accordance with any procedure made under item 6;

    2.  in the absence or failure of any such procedure—in accordance with
        any procedure made by State Council; and

    3.  in exceptional circumstances—by State Council.

2. ## Notice

    Branch members must be given adequate notice of each meeting.

3. ## Quorum

    1.  The quorum for a branch meeting is:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  for branches with 15 or more members—six branch members; and

        2.  for other branches—four branch members.

        </subclause-letters>

    2.  There is no quorum for an election deliberation session or part
        of a meeting at which a members’ plebiscite is being considered
        or voted on.

4. ## Proceedings

    1.  A branch meeting must comply with the requirements in [clause 4](./01-fundamental-matters.md#4).

    2.  A branch meeting must decide its own agenda.

    3.  The types of proposal that may be put to a branch meeting are:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  a procedural proposal; and

        2.  a substantive proposal.

        </subclause-letters>

    4.  A proposal that is put to a vote is passed if it meets the
        following requirements:

     <table>
     <colgroup>
     <col style={{width: "30%"}} />
     <col style={{width: "69%"}} />
     </colgroup>
     <thead>
     <tr className="header">
     <th><strong>Type</strong></th>
     <th><strong>Requirements</strong></th>
     </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
     <tr className="odd">
     <td>Procedural proposal</td>
     <td>A majority of branch members in attendance who vote on the proposal vote in favour</td>
     </tr>
     <tr className="even">
     <td>Substantive proposal</td>
     <td>At least two thirds of the branch members in attendance who vote on the proposal vote in favour</td>
     </tr>
     </tbody>
     </table>

5. ## Proxies

    Proxy voting at branch meetings is not allowed.

6.  ## Additional procedures

    1.  A branch may, by a substantive proposal, make additional meeting
        procedures that are consistent with these procedures.

    2.  State Council may revoke such procedures in exceptional
        circumstances.
