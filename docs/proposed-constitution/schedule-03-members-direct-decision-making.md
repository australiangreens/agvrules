    <col style={{width: "49%"}} />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>

    available to members.


3. ## Members’ plebiscite

    1.  If a plebiscite is initiated on a proposal different from the
        joint branch proposal, the three branch delegates may, within
        seven days, by unanimous agreement, decide that the joint branch
        proposal must also be included (***double plebiscite***).

    2.  In the case of a double plebiscite, the Committee must decide
        whether:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  the two proposals are independent of each other; or

        2.  one proposal is an alternative (***alternative proposal***)
            to the other (***primary proposal***).

        </subclause-letters>

    3.  A plebiscite must be conducted in accordance with the following
        principles:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  freedom of debate and truthful communication;

        2.  informed voting; and

        3.  substantial compliance is sufficient compliance.

        </subclause-letters>

    4.  If a plebiscite is initiated, the Committee must:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  give each member a document that sets out:

            1.  the issue and the proposal(s);

            2.  the financial implications (if any) of the proposal(s)
                being passed;

            3.  arguments provided by members in favour of the
                proposal(s);

            4.  arguments provided by members against the proposal(s);
                and

            5.  State Council’s position (if any) regarding the
                proposal(s); and

        2.  make reasonable efforts to see that each branch arranges for
            the proposal(s) to be properly considered and voted on.

        </subclause-letters>

    5.  Arguments under sub-item (4)(a) must not be attributed to an
        author.

    6.  Within 60 days after each member is given the document in
        sub-item (4)(a):

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  each branch must arrange for its members to consider and
            vote on the proposal(s) by show of hands and advise the
            Committee in writing of the results of the vote(s); and

        2.  the Committee must convene at least five meetings for
            members to consider and vote on the proposal(s) by show of
            hands.

        </subclause-letters>

    7.  Each member may vote in a plebiscite only once.

    8.  The failure of a branch to arrange for its members to consider
        and vote on the proposal(s) does not, alone, invalidate a
        plebiscite.

    9.  A proposal is passed if the following criteria are satisfied:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  at least 60% of the votes are in favour;

        2.  the votes in favour exceed the votes against by at least 3%
            of the whole membership;

        3.  it is not the case that a majority of members at a majority
            of branch meetings in which votes were cast voted against
            the proposal; and

        4.  where the proposal in question is the alternative proposal
            in a double plebiscite—the primary proposal was not passed.

        </subclause-letters>

    10. The Committee must:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  declare whether each proposal (***members’ plebiscite
            proposal***) was passed; and

        2.  make the results of the vote(s), generally and broken down
            by branch and other meetings, available to members.

        </subclause-letters>

    11. State Council must remove a proposal from a plebiscite if:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  it is not a permitted proposal about the issue;

        2.  it would, if passed, be illegal or involve the Party in
            illegality; or

        3.  it would, if passed, cause the Party to become insolvent or
            create a substantial risk that the Party will become
            insolvent.

        </subclause-letters>

    12. The Committee may, after hearing from the branch delegates and
        State Council, terminate a plebiscite or remove a proposal from
        a plebiscite if it considers that it has been rendered
        redundant.
