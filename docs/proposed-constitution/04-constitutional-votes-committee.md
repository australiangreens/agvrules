<u>At a glance</u>

A 3-member Constitutional Votes Committee is responsible for the votes required by
the Constitution, which are State Council elections and members’ plebiscites.

This Part sets out the Constitutional Votes Committee’s responsibilities and powers and
provides for appointment and vacation of office of members of the Constitutional Votes
Committee.

[Schedule 7](./schedule-07-eligibility-requirements.md) sets out eligibility requirements for members of the Constitutional Votes
Committee.

<u>Summary and Explanation</u>

Part 4 creates the Constitutional Votes Committee (**Committee**). The general functions
of the 3-member Committee are to act like a returning officer for State Council elections
and for the process leading to and including members’ plebiscites. It is separate from
the State Council and responsible for establishing and enforcing rules and procedures
about the conduct of elections and votes under the Constitution. The independence of
the Committee is underlined by the fact that it is the only body whose decisions
override those of State Council (clause 18(5)).

The Committee is not a general-purpose returning officer for other elections or
preselections; it can only do the tasks given to it by the Constitution.

The procedures for the Committee and for what happens if the Committee has a
vacancy are set out in part 4. The eligibility requirements are set out in [Schedule 7](./schedule-07-eligibility-requirements.md).
