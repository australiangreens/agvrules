# Procedures for Urgent Withdrawal of Party Endorsement of a Candidate for Public Office

1.  Any endorsed candidate for public office may be removed as a
    candidate under these procedures. In this bylaw, the “ERC” shall
    mean the Endorsement Review Committee constituted under this bylaw.

2.  These procedures cease at any stage should the relevant candidate
    withdraw as a candidate.

3.  These procedures must be initiated by a notice, which may be in
    writing or by telephone, from a public office-holder (including the
    Parliamentary Leader of the Australian Greens), or a member of State
    Council, to the State Convenor or Secretary or the convenor of the
    State-wide campaign committee, which notice need only state the name
    of the candidate proposed for de-selection, but may include any
    other relevant matter.

4.  If possible, the State Convenor, the Secretary and the convenor of
    the State-wide campaign committee shall confer. If any of them
    thinks the matter should proceed, they shall forthwith:

    1.  advise the candidate;

    2.  convene the ERC; and

    3.  advise any relevant Regional Convenor.

5.  The ERC shall be convened at a time having regard to the
    desirability of allowing sufficient time for the candidate to
    respond, but also to any urgency having regard to the political
    circumstances, but in any case shall not be convened until at least
    8 hours (excluding midnight to 6am) after a written notice has been
    sent to the candidate setting out the reasons why it is considered
    necessary that they might need to be disendorsed, advising the time
    and place of the ERC meeting (and any phone number by which its
    meeting may be attended). The candidate should have the opportunity
    to address the ERC, and every attempt shall be made to contact the
    candidate to ensure that the notice has been received. Copies of the
    notice shall be sent to the relevant Regional Convenor and, in the
    case of a Federal candidate, to the Parliamentary Leader of the
    Australian Greens. The ERC shall consist of:

    1.  the Convenor or nominee, or where the Convenor is absent or
        fails to nominate, the Secretary or nominee;

    2.  the convenor of the State-wide campaign committee or nominee, or
        where the convenor of the State-wide campaign committee is
        absent or fails to nominate, the secretary of the State-wide
        campaign committee;

    3.  a person elected (or agreed by consensus) by and from those
        members of State Council present at a meeting of State Council
        who are or have been a candidate for public office during the
        previous 5 years. However, the person elected shall not at the
        time of the ERC meeting be a current candidate or public
        office-holder. (An election for this position shall be held in
        every second year or whenever necessary. However, the person
        elected shall in any case hold office until replaced.) If that
        person is unwilling, absent or disqualified, they shall be
        replaced on the ERC by a person of at least 10 years membership
        who has been more than once a candidate for public office,
        nominated by the Convenor or Secretary.

6.  The ERC shall determine its own procedures having regard to the
    circumstances and urgency of the matter. All proceedings before the
    ERC are confidential. The ERC shall have access to all relevant
    probity documents and candidate agreements, and may interview any
    person involved in any probity check. In the case of a Federal
    candidate, the Parliamentary Leader of the Australian Greens shall
    have the right to confer with the ERC, and in any case, the ERC
    shall have regard to her or his advice, which may be given in
    confidence.

7.  The terms of reference of the ERC shall be to determine whether, in
    all the circumstances there are clear and compelling reasons why it
    is in the interests of the Party to cancel a candidate’s
    endorsement, and if the ERC so determines, it shall cancel the
    candidate’s endorsement.

8.  Proceedings before the ERC are not disciplinary or penalty
    proceedings. Therefore,

    1.  it is not necessary that any allegation or suggestion in
        relation to any conduct by the candidate be proven for the ERC
        to make any decision;

    2.  where an issue involves an allegation or suggestion related to
        any past or present conduct by the candidate, the ERC has no
        brief to make any adverse determinative findings of fact against
        the candidate in respect of that alleged or suggested conduct.
        (This does not prevent any subsequent disciplinary proceedings
        against a candidate or former candidate in accordance with other
        relevant party procedures.);

    3.  where a decision to cancel the candidate’s endorsement occurs in
        circumstance where the candidate denies any allegation or
        suggestions in relation to his or her conduct, any public
        statement by the Party shall acknowledge this denial.

9.  The ERC may authorise the making of a statement on behalf of the AGV
    following its decision. Where appropriate, an attempt shall be made
    to reach agreement with the candidate or former candidate about the
    terms of that statement.

10. A decision of the ERC to cancel a candidate’s pre-selection must be
    by consensus, but is final, provided that the ERC may refer the
    matter to the State Executive for a final decision if it is not
    certain, and shall do so if it cannot reach consensus. In this case,
    an Executive meeting shall be called forthwith to determine the
    matter. The members of the ERC and the Parliamentary Leader of the
    Australian Greens shall as far as practicable, be in attendance, but
    otherwise the meeting shall be closed, unless the Executive decides
    that others may attend.
