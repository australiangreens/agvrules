# Expenditure Administration

1.  All expenditure approvals must be allocated to an item in the
    current approved AGV budget.

2.  Once the AGV budget is approved, any AGV members who are solely or
    jointly responsible for expenditure decisions are responsible for
    only approving expenditure within the approved budget, unless they
    gain approval from FAIC for a budget adjustment to accommodate the
    increased spend.

3.  The State Director is responsible for authorising expenditure within
    the AGV budget, subject to the following conditions:

    1.  The State Council has approved that a committee or working group
        is accountable for a specific budget item, in which case
        responsibility passes to that committee or working group.

    2.  The State Director has delegated expenditure authorisation for
        specific budget items to AGV staff. In such an event, the State
        Director still retains accountability for the budget item
        against which the authority has been delegated.

    3.  Where expenditure will result in the relevant budget item being
        exceeded by no more than $5,000, the State Director must
        nominate an alternate budget item or items to be reduced by the
        same value.

    4.  An expenditure increase of more than $5,000 shall be referred to
        FAIC for consideration and if appropriate, funds reallocation
        within the approved budget.

    5.  In event that the State Director takes leave, they must delegate
        their authorities temporarily to another AGV staff member/s or
        State Office Bearer.

    6.  Delegation of authority shall be in writing and shall indicate
        the period for such delegation applies and/or when such
        delegation expires.

    7.  In the event that State Council or State Executive has revoked a
        delegate's authorities and the State Director is on a leave of
        absence, authorities pass to the AGV Secretary.

    8.  The AGV Secretary can temporarily assume the authorities of the
        State Director in the event of:

        1.  The State Director is on a leave of absence and has not
            delegated their authorities; or

        2.  The State Director or AGV staff member to whom authority has
            been delegated in the State Director's absence, is unable to
            make the authorisation before the payment by the time it
            falls due.

4.  In the event that a committee or working group is allocated a
    budget, the convener of the committee or working group is
    accountable for:

    1.  Creating a detailed budget for how the funds allocated to the
        group or committee should be spent.

    2.  Approving spending in accordance with that budget.

    3.  Ensuring that expenditure is only made in accordance with that
        budget.

5.  FAIC and State Executive must be notified by email or other written
    communication of any delegation of spending authority.

6.  Any AGV member or Party body may put forward an expenditure or
    income proposal to FAIC for review. The proposal should include
    details of the expenditure (or income) including, but not limited
    to, the cost and benefits of accepting the proposal.

7.  Following FAIC's review of the expenditure/income proposal, FAIC can
    do any of the following:

    1.  approve the proposal if the amount in question is less than
        $5000 and corresponding budget offsets can be found or in line
        with the powers granted in the Finance, Administration and
        Infrastructure Committee Bylaw.

    2.  recommend the proposal to State Council for approval; or

    3.  return the proposal to the proposer requesting further detail;
        or

    4.  choose not to recommend the proposal for approval.

8.  State Council must approve expenditure outside the existing AGV
    budget that will alter the bottom line. By approving such proposals,
    State Council is acknowledging that the additional expenditure will
    result in a reduction in the surplus or increase in the deficit.
