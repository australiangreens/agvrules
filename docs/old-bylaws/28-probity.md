# Probity


## Definitions

Election Period: Defined as the period from when nominations for any
election are opened until the election occurs.

Probity Check: A probity check investigates the background of an
individual to determine their suitability to be a candidate.

Decision-making period: The period when the Probity Panel considers and
comes to a decision about a nominee being the time commencing when all
probity-related nomination documentation has been sent to the Probity
Panel, and concluding when a probity decision has been reported to the
Returning Officer.

## Probity Panel

1.  There shall be established a Probity Panel whose duty it is to carry
    out all probity checks on all nominees for external positions.

2.  The purpose of the Probity Panel is to judge the suitability of
    members who nominate to stand as candidates in external elections.
    In so doing, it is not the task of the Probity Panel to make
    conclusive findings of fact in relation to any matter adverse to a
    nominee, nor is this necessary for the Probity Panel to reject a
    nomination.

3.  Noting that the AGV Constitution states \[at 8.1\] that
    *“All AGV Members are entitled to the following benefits: … (f) To be
    eligible to seek nomination for public office as a candidate for the
    Greens (NC 9.8), subject to clause 56.13”,*

    probity should only be rejected where there are compelling and serious
    reasons why, in the interests of the AGV, the member should be deemed
    not suitable to stand as a candidate.

1.  The paramount duty of the Probity Panel is to make decisions in the
    best interests of the AGV. The Probity Panel will, in this regard,
    consider the values, policy positions and political imperatives of
    the party in making all decisions.

## Probity Panel Composition

1.  There will be a minimum of 11 people appointed to the Probity Panel.

2.  Probity Panel members will be appointed by State Council, as per
    Schedule 1, for a term of 2 years. Their terms will run from the
    date of appointment to two years from the date of their appointment.

3.  Members of the Probity Panel and any Sub-Panels should to the
    greatest extent possible be disinterested persons in relation any
    matter they consider.

4.  The Probity Panel will appoint its convenor and secretary.

5.  All Probity Panel members must be members of the Party.

6.  A Probity Sub-Panel shall be comprised of between three and seven
    members.

7.  Members of a particular Sub-Panel will be appointed by the Probity
    Panel as a whole, or by a person or persons assigned by the Probity
    Panel to do this, in which case the composition of each Sub-Panel so
    appointed will be reported to the next meeting of the Probity Panel.

8.  Members of a Probity Sub-Panel must not include any individual:



1.  appointed as Returning Officer or as an advisor to a Returning
    Officer for a position which the sub-panel is considering.

2.  who is a nominee or nominator for a position which the sub-panel is
    considering.

3.  who is a fellow branch member of a nominee for a position which the
    sub-panel is considering.

4.  who would be perceived to have a conflict of interest in relation to
    a nominee or the position which the sub-panel is considering.



1.  Members of the Probity Panel may not carry out probity checks or be
    involved in those checks in any way where a nomination is related to
    any campaign in which they are involved.

2.  Casual vacancies on the Probity Panel may be filled by the State
    Council or State Executive following a call for expressions of
    interest via the appropriate internal Party communication methods,
    as per Schedule 1.

## Probity Panel General Operations

1.  Any decision of the Probity Panel must be made by at least 3 of its
    members (a sub-panel). Consensus decisions of a sub-panel shall be
    decisions of the Probity Panel.

2.  Subject to this bylaw, deliberations of the Probity Panel are
    confidential.

3.  All Probity Panel members will sign a confidentiality agreement.

4.  A record of all nominations, the related investigations and findings
    will be securely maintained by the State Secretary.

5.  Records of nominations are confidential to the Probity Panel and the
    Returning Officer in the first instance. However the State
    Executive, Victorian Campaign Committee and any relevant
    preselecting body (where a preselection panel has been appointed)
    will have the right to inspect the record of any individual where
    they are considering a matter related to and relevant to that
    member.

6.  The Probity Panel may meet in person or via electronic means,
    including email.

7.  The Probity Panel will keep minutes of all its meetings and records
    of its activities.

8.  The Probity Panel will report in written form on its activities:



1.  To the State Conference annually,

2.  To the Victorian Campaign Committee monthly during Local, State or
    Federal election periods.

3.  At any time as requested by the Victorian Campaign Committee, State
    Executive or State Council.

## Probity Checks

1.  Noting that the paramount duty of the Probity Panel is to make
    decisions in the best interests of the AGV, the Probity Panel
    should, so far as consistent with this duty, keep in mind fairness
    to the nominee in the conduct of any probity check.

2.  A probity check will be conducted on all nominees for public office,
    excepting any nominee who

    1.  has been approved by a Probity Panel within the previous 3
        years; and

    2.  provides a statutory declaration stating that no matters
        relevant to probity have substantially changed since their last
        Probity check; and

    3.  the most senior staff member member, Convenor of the Misconduct
        Panel, and Victorian Campaign Committee Convenor and electorate
        or regional campaign committee convenor can confirm that no
        matters relevant to probity have substantially changed since
        their last probity check.

3.  By the close of nominations, nominees must submit:



1.  a completed Probity Form as prescribed from time to time by the VCC;

2.  a signed Statutory Declaration attesting to the correctness of the
    Preselection and Probity Forms, and agreeing to a Police Check if
    the Returning Officer or Probity Panel deem it necessary;

3.  any other document or form requested by the Probity Panel or a
    Probity sub-panel.

provided that a nominee who has been approved by a Probity Panel
within the previous 3 years may provide the statutory declaration
described in clause 24(b) above in substitution for the documents
required in this clause and a check will be conducted with the most
senior staff member and Victorian Campaign Committee or relevant
election campaign committee Convenor to confirm this.

1.  The Returning Officer shall pass any envelopes or attachments
    containing the probity documents to the Probity Panel unopened.

2.  The Probity Panel is empowered to carry out any investigations it
    deems necessary into any nomination.

3.  Each probity check shall include, at a minimum:



1.  scrutiny of the probity form and accompanying Statutory Declaration;

2.  assiduous and reasonable searches of available online information
    about the nominee, their professional and community organisation
    affiliations, and their media presence, if any (except if the
    nominee is an elected representative);

3.  a request for any relevant information from the AGV Misconduct
    Panel;

4.  an invitation for input from local Branch and regional bodies’
    office bearers and party officials;

5.  consideration of any objections to or concerns about probity raised
    by other Members.

and assessment of nominees after appropriate input from local Branch
and regional bodies’ office bearers, party officials and other members
as considered necessary.

1.  The nominee shall provide:



1.  All names that they have used or previously been known by,

2.  All pseudonyms that they use or have previously used,

3.  Access to all Probity sub-panel members of all social media and
    online engagement accounts currently in use by the nominee or
    which were in use within the previous five (5) years. This access
    shall be maintained for the duration of the decision-making
    period. This access may include, for example, allowing Probity
    sub-panel members to ‘friend’ them on Facebook, ensuring Probity
    sub-panel members can ‘follow’ all of the nominee’s Twitter
    accounts and ensuring any other action is taken which provides the
    Probity sub-panel members such access.



1.  The Probity Panel may contact any person while conducting a probity
    check without reference to the nominee.

2.  Confidentiality will be maintained as follows:



1.  Any person contacted by the Probity Panel will be advised of the
    confidential nature of the process in that they should not
    disclose that the person has nominated, nor should they disclose
    the questions asked by or their response made to the Probity Panel
    to any other person.

2.  All responses received by the Probity Panel shall be kept
    confidential to the Probity Panel and shall only be disclosed as a
    non-identifying summary should clause 41 be enacted.

## Probity Decisions

1.  The Probity Panel shall make a finding for each nomination received
    by the end of the decision-making period that the nomination be:



1.  approved, or

2.  approved subject to certain conditions outlined by the Probity
    Panel, or

3.  approved noting risk/communication matters if preselected, or

4.  rejected.

A sub-panel may only make this finding by consensus. Should consensus
not be achieved the nomination will be considered by the full Probity
Panel, at which a majority will be required to make the finding.
>
Subject to 34, 39 and 40 below, the decision-making period must be no
later than fourteen (14) days (or 48 hours in the case of a snap
election) after the close of nominations.
>
In the case of a nominee being approved with conditions, the State
Director, or their delegate, will be informed in writing within 72
hours by the Probity Panel. If the nominee gains preselection, the
convenor of the relevant body responsible for the preselection will be
provided a summary of conditions by the Probity Panel. The convenor of
the relevant body responsible for preselection will be tasked with
tracking compliance of conditions. Any breaches of conditions must
then be referred to the Endorsement Review Committee.

1.  The Probity Panel shall have the authority to:



1.  request further statutory declarations from any nominee should the
    panel judge that more information be required to make an
    assessment on any nomination.

2.  interview any nominee should the panel judge that more information
    be required to make an assessment on any nomination.

In these circumstances, the decision-making period may be extended to
allow reasonable time for the nominee to comply.

1.  If the nomination is approved subject to certain conditions or
    rejected, the decision shall be considered to be an interim decision
    until the process at 39 – 40 is complete, whereby a final decision
    will be made.

2.  The Probity Panel members considering a nomination shall reject any
    nomination where:



1.  the sub-panel judges that the candidacy of the nominee concerned
    would be inappropriate,

2.  the sub-panel judges that the candidacy of the nominee would be
    detrimental to the Australian Greens Victoria on grounds relating
    to past conduct, character or reputation,

3.  the candidate has not given an undertaking to support stated party
    policy, subject to clause 51.2 of the constitution, or in lieu of
    that undertaking, has not provided pre-selectors with an
    explanation as to which policies the candidate does not support.



1.  The Probity Panel shall have the authority to reject any nomination
    on the grounds that the nominee:



1.  refuses to co-operate with the probity panel

2.  fails to comply with any conditions outlined in the relevant Code of
    Conduct forms

3.  fails to comply with any conditions outlined in the Confidentiality
    Agreement

4.  fails to comply with any condition imposed upon the nominee in
    relation to their nomination (as per 35 (b) above)

5.  holds a public position in opposition to Party policy, and the
    probity sub-panel deems the matter to be so serious as to damage
    the party’s electoral opportunities.

Prima facie a serious falsehood or apparent serious concealment of
facts or issues in probity forms is grounds for a nomination to be
rejected.

1.  Where the Probity Panel rejects a nomination, the nominee may not
    nominate for any other position at the same election.

2.  When an interim decision is made to either approve a nomination
    subject to certain conditions or reject a nomination, the following
    will occur:



1.  The Probity sub-panel will prepare a document setting out the
    reasons for the decision.

2.  The nominee will be provided with the reasons for decision and shall
    have 48 hours to provide a response to the Probity sub-panel.

3.  The reasons for the decision may include a summary of feedback
    received, without breaching the confidentiality requirements at
    clause 31.

4.  The Probity sub-panel will consider any response from the nominee in
    making a final decision.

5.  A final decision will be made within 48 hours of receipt of any
    response from the nominee. If the nominee fails to provide a
    response, the original decision will stand.

In these circumstances, the decision-making period may be extended to
allow for these processes to occur.

1.  Clause 38 above shall not apply in the circumstances of a
    snap-election.

2.  When a decision is approved noting that risk and/or communications
    matters require attention, the Returning Officer will notify the
    Probity Panel of the nominee’s preselection. Then the convenor of
    the Probity Panel will then inform the State Director. In
    consultation, either the convenor of the Probity Panel or the State
    Director, or their delegate, will inform the convenor of the
    relevant body responsible for the preselection in writing of the
    risk and communications issues which require a plan.

3.  Decisions of the Probity Panel:



1.  will be reported to the relevant Returning Officer and the nominee
    within 24 hours of the decision

2.  may be appealed to the State Executive.

## Rights of Nominees

1.  A nominee will be informed of who is on the Probity Panel and which
    members will be reviewing their nomination.

2.  A nominee will be informed as soon as practical of any decision by
    the Probity Panel in relation to their nomination, in accordance
    with clauses 32 and 38 above.

3.  A nominee may provide a written response to any decision to approve
    their nomination subject to conditions, or to reject their
    nomination, in accordance with clause 38 above.

4.  A nominee may appeal a decision of the Probity Panel to the State
    Executive in accordance with clause 41 above within 24 hours of
    receipt of any decision to approve their nomination subject to
    conditions, or to reject their nomination. A decision will be made
    by State Executive within 24 hours of the appeal.

5.  A nomination for any position is considered confidential until the
    nominations close and the Probity Panel has completed its work.
    Until that time nominations may be withdrawn without prejudice.
    After that time an announcement of the nominations will be made on
    the internal AGV website.

## Confidentiality of Records

1.  All records in relation to the making of a decision in respect of a
    probity decision shall be kept securely and separately for a period
    of 5 years, provided that Police Checks will be securely destroyed
    as soon as they are no longer needed. The State Secretary will have
    the responsibility of safe custody.

2.  All members of the Probity Panel will be responsible for permanently
    deleting any electronic copies they hold of documents related to
    Probity Panel decisions (other than Panel minutes) within one month
    of the election with respect to which the probity decisions related.
