# Mutual Responsibilities Between Elected Representatives and Party Bodies, Officers and Members

1.  All Greens public office-holders\* have a responsibility under the
    constitution and this bylaw to report regularly to relevant party
    bodies\* and to the Greens membership generally and within their own
    constituencies. Office bearers also have a responsibility to provide
    reports and information to elected public officeholders.

2.  Reporting regularly is an important means by which public
    office-holders remain accountable to the party.

3.  It is expected that all public office-holders of the party will
    attend State Conference whenever possible, and provide a verbal
    report, which will be listed for discussion.

4.  At each regular meeting of State Council, a verbal report from the
    federal parliamentarians representatives, the state parliamentarians
    representatives and the local government representatives will be
    listed for discussion. Where no representatives are in attendance, a
    written report must be submitted.

5.  Party members should not assume that, acting as individuals, they
    have any special or privileged access or rights in relation to
    elected representatives as compared to constituents generally.
    Similarly, elected representatives, while they have special
    expertise and knowledge, have no more right than other members to
    direct the work of Party bodies.

## Reporting and Liaison Requirements

1.  The reporting arrangements need not be mechanical or prescriptive,
    but must ensure that:

    1.  in the case of public office-holders, the relevant bodies are
        provided with a verbal report (default) or written report (if
        attendance is not possible), which should aim to cover:

        1.  main activities undertaken;

        2.  key decisions made as a public office-holder;

        3.  major issues which are pending;

        4.  the planned approach to these issues; and

        5.  issues in which they are involved where their position is
            likely to involve considerable public controversy or are
            likely to be controversial within the Party. In these
            circumstances, wherever possible, a report should be
            provided in sufficient time to allow relevant party bodies\*
            to consider the issue when that consideration will still be
            relevant;

    2.  in the case of office-bearers of relevant regions or branches,
        relevant public office-holders are advised of the views of
        relevant party bodies, about matters within the current work or
        priorities of the public office-holders, faithfully and in good
        time, particularly where issues have become or are likely to
        become controversial within the Party.
