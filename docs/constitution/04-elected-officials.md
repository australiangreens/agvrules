51. ## Greens in Public Office

    1. The actions and activities of AGV Members who hold public office, and of all endorsed
    candidates for the AGV, must be consistent with the Charter of the Greens, and with the
    Objectives of the AGV laid down in this Constitution.

    2. AGV Members who hold public office as endorsed candidates of the Greens will also adhere to
    the policies of the Greens, except that, in rare or special circumstances where the views of an
    elected Member are in conflict with the Greens’ policy, then that elected Member may vote
    according to their conscience.

    3. When an elected Member or candidate recognises a potential conflict between their conscience
    and the Greens’ policy, then such an elected representative or candidate will furnish a statement
    accounting for this position to the State Council, and in the case of a member of Federal
    Parliament, to the National Council of the Australian Greens, for their information. AGV
    Members elected to, or candidates for, positions in local government will provide such a
    statement to their Branch, where the circumstances require it.

    4. The obligation of an AGV public officer to comply with Greens policy is met when that Member
    complies with the approved Greens policy relevant to their jurisdiction.

    5. Where more than one AGV Member is elected to any jurisdiction, each elected Member has an
    obligation to attempt to reach a consensus position on all substantive matters before them.

    6. When an elected AGV Member does not vote for the implementation of an AGV policy, then
    they will, at the earliest opportunity, furnish a statement to the State Council, accounting for the
    reason why he or she so voted.

    7. Members in public office may hold meetings with AGV Members in their electorate from time to
    time and will do so within thirty days of being requested to do so by:
    1. ten percent or50.  (whichever is the lesser) of the Members in the relevant electorate; or
    2. a Branch or Branches representing one-third of the Members in the electorate; or
    3. State Council in the case of the Senator(s) representing Victoria.

    8. The agenda for an electorate meeting will include any matters placed on it by the public office
    holder or by the Members requesting the meeting, or by any Branch within the electorate.
    Electorate meetings do not have binding decision-making power.

    9. Subject to clause 51.10, members who hold public office must not:


    1. to any degree, displace or interfere with the role of the Mediation Panel (except in matters
    that are exclusively between members who hold public office), Administrative Review
    Panel or Misconduct Panel; and
    2. make any public statement regarding a matter being dealt with, or that has been dealt with,
    under chapters 8, 9 or10.  that has not been approved in writing (in specific or general
    terms) by the State Convenor.

    10. clause 51.91. does not prohibit a member who holds public office from requesting assistance
    under clause 79.1, making an application under clause 83.1 or making a misconduct allegation
    under clause 87.1.
