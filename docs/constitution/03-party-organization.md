    requirement for a meeting, the attendance of one of the job-share Office Bearers will be
    sufficient to satisfy such a requirement.

    job-share Office Bearers differ, and both exercise their right to vote, their votes will cancel each
    other out.

    individual:

        1. ceases to be an AGV Member;

        2. resigns in writing; or

        fulfil their designated responsibilities.

    9. Where an Office Bearer, or a Victorian Campaign Committee Convenor or a Policy Convenor,
    who holds a position on a job-share basis ceases to hold office but the other person who also
    holds that position does not cease to hold office, then the remaining holder of that office holds
    office until the end of the next meeting of the State Council, which shall at that meeting make a
    determination to either:

        1. confirm the remaining holder of the position as the only holder of that position, in a secret
        ballot vote which shall require 75% of votes cast to be in favour; or

        2. confirm a nomination made by the remaining holder of that position, of another member to
        fill the vacancy and serve in the position on a job-share basis, in a vote requiring75. % of
        votes cast to be in favour.

    In the absence of the occurrence of 1. or 2. at that meeting, the position becomes vacant.

    a Special State Conference. If elected at a State Conference, State Office Bearers will be elected
    by consensus or, failing this consensus, they will be elected by a secret ballot of all AGV
    Members present at the State Conference.

    3. Any vote will be by an optional preferential system and will include an option to ‘seek further
    candidates’ rather than requiring election of one of the candidates.

    State Conference, if appropriate), in person or in writing, to standing for such office.

    the term of office was due to end, a postal or electronic vote of all AGV Members or a Special
    State Conference must be held to fill the vacant position, save that where a single nomination is
    received for the casual vacancy then State Council may appoint that person to fill the position
    without the need for any postal or electronic ballot or any Special State Conference.

    9. If at any time a State Office Bearer position is vacant, the State Council will, within fourteen
    days after the vacancy arises, appoint an acting State Office Bearer from the existing members of

    Branches that wish to retain a structure above the level of the Branch, to coordinate Branch
    responsibilities within a defined area of Victoria in conjunction with and on behalf of those
    Branches.

34. ### Definitions

    1. In this Chapter, the following terms have the specific meanings given below:

        1. ‘Upper House Region’ means the geographic region corresponding with a single electoral

        Regional Council in respect of that Region. For the purposes of this clause, a Branch
        whose boundaries include parts of more than one Upper House Region will be deemed to
        be a Branch within the Upper House Region in which the majority of the Branch’s
        members reside on the most recent census date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Branch
        may chose not to join with other Branches in creating a Regional Council under this
        provision.

    representing a majority of AGV Members within the Region, resolve to that effect within a

        have the responsibility to liaise with Branches within their Region about matters within

    consult any Branch will also apply to a Regional Council in the same terms.

        vacancy in the position of such a representative;

    the Constitution, all the Representatives to State Council from the Region will be elected in one
    ballot from all the members of the Region. In this case, the number of Representatives so elected
    will be the same as it would be under section40.  had such a decision not been made.

    2. A Regional Council may revoke a determination made under clause 37.1.

    3. A determination under clause 37 .1 or a revocation under clause 37.2 has effect from the next

    percent majority.

    3. A substantive motion carried by vote, unless provided for elsewhere in the Constitution, requires

    the motion. Abstentions do not count as a vote, either for or against. For the purposes of this

    including by using small group discussions, subcommittees or working parties where
    appropriate.

    8. All meetings of the AGV will be open to all AGV Members and invited members of the general
    public. At meetings of constituent groups consisting of elected representatives or delegates, the

    in this Constitution as well as at the discretion of the meeting facilitator/convenor.

    49 Decision Making through Postal or Electronic Ballots

    1. A constituent group meeting may decide to poll relevant AGV Members through a postal or
    electronic ballot (to be funded by the constituent group). For the results of the ballot to be valid,

    motion to succeed it must be approved by at least75.  percent of the valid votes cast.

    arrangements for eligible Members who are not readily able to access the relevant electronic
    means.

    5. Postal or electronic votes will be counted by the Returning Officer appointed by the State
    Council.

    6. State Council may make further provision for the manner of conducting electronic or postal
    ballots in a bylaw.

    1. The QDMG will make decisions for the Party body regarding any matter of such urgency
    that it must be resolved before the next scheduled meeting of the Party body;

    2. Whilst it is the Convenor who is normally required to attempt to contact all QDMG
    members, if necessary, any member of the QDMG can call the meeting.

    3. The composition of the Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) is as follows:


    1. The QDMG for the State Executive will comprise the State Convenor, the State Secretary,
    the State Treasurer and three persons appointed by and from the other members of the

    members for any other Party body’s QDMG.

    4. Procedures for the Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) include the following:


    1. The QDMG will meet only as often as essential;

    2. The QDMG may meet face to face or by teleconference, or by electronic communication.
    In emergencies, the QDMG may simply engage in telephone consultation;

    3. In matters relating to particular regions or issues, the QDMG will consult where possible
    with constituent groups or Party Members who may be directly affected by the decision;

    4. The QDMG’s decisions will be made by consensus only.

    5. The Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) must keep a written record of any decisions made
    and present it to the next meeting of its Party body.

    6. Decisions of a Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) take effect immediately. If a decision of
    a QDMG is not ratified by the conclusion of the next quorate meeting of its Party body, the
    decision lapses and, to the maximum extent possible, is to be taken to have never been made.
