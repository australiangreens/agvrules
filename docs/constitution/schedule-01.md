title: Schedule 1
---

1. Whereas at the time of the adoption of certain amendments to the Constitution which commenced in
    February20. 12, there were a number of Branches in existence whose geographic jurisdiction did not
    correspond to one or more Local Government Area, the purpose of this Schedule is to:
       1. ensure that within such Local Government Areas (only), either those Branches may continue
          or other arrangements as provided for in this Schedule are given effect; and
       2. prescribe the representation of such Branches on State Council.
2. The Local Government Areas referred to in clause 1 of this Schedule are the City of Greater Geelong,
    the Borough of Queenscliffe and the Shire of Yarra Ranges. The Branches referred to in clause 1
    (being those which were in existence at the time of the amendments to the Constitution in February
   20. 12 and still in existence at the time of the inclusion of this Schedule in the Constitution) are
    Geelong and District, Bellarine, Dandenong Ranges, Healesville and Upper Yarra. These are referred
    to in this Schedule respectively as ‘Schedule 1 LGAs’ and ‘Schedule 1 Branches.’
3. Notwithstanding the terms of the Constitution, but subject to this Schedule, each Schedule 1 Branch
    shall continue in existence and shall have the same geographic jurisdiction (or such expanded
    jurisdiction as State Council may determine, but only for the purpose of ensuring that each AGV
    member within a Schedule 1 LGA is covered by the jurisdiction of a Schedule 1 Branch) unless and
    until that Branch votes to dissolve itself or lapses or is suspended in accordance with the Constitution
    and is not re-established within12.  months. Should such a Branch vote to merge with another Branch
    it may only do so if it amalgamates with another Branch or Branches in the same Schedule 1 LGA; or
    otherwise such that the resultant merged Branch corresponds to one or more Local Government Area.
4. Where a Schedule 1 Branch exists whose jurisdiction does not correspond to one or more Local
    Government Area, the representation on State Council of the relevant Branches by Branch
    Representatives will be such that the AGV members in each Schedule 1 LGA shall, if it has at least15. 
    AGV members, elect one Branch Representative to State Council (including to a casual vacancy), in
    accordance with any by law enacted by State Council, or in default of such a by law, by a postal ballot
    of the relevant AGV Members conducted at the same time as elections for regional representatives.
5. Where the person or committee appointed by the State Executive is responsible for determining which
    Legislative Council region a Branch falls into for the purposes of State Council representation,
    Schedule 1 Branches which abut each other must all be assigned to the same Legislative Council
    region, which shall be the Legislative Council region that a plurality of members of the abutting
    Schedule 1 Branches reside within.
6. Whereas certain functions, powers and responsibilities are vested in a Branch under clauses:


1.24. .1 5. (replacing a State Council representative);

2.24. .1 8. (endorsing local government candidates);

3.55. . 1 (Branches being local government campaign committees);

4.56. .4 1. (local government pre-selection); and
5.57. .1 (preferences in local government);

in the case of Branches within or partly within Schedule 1 LGAs, State Council may enact by laws
prescribing how such decisions may be made jointly by the relevant Schedule 1 Branches or by the
members of those Branches. In default of such by laws any decision which would otherwise be made
by a Branch corresponding to one or more Local Government Area may be made by concurrent
decisions of all the relevant Branches.
