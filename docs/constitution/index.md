<u>Overview</u>

The constitution of a political party is its key governance document. An organisation
consists of different people who will want different things and have different views.
The constitution tells us how the members have decided that decisions will be made,
how power is distributed and exercised, and who gets to decide what. Most people will
agree that our Constitution needs to be both democratic – reflecting in some way the
views of the membership – and effective – capable of giving effect to its objectives.

Below is a thematic explanation of what is proposed. Where important, clauses are
mentioned.

The key elements of the proposed new structure are:

* A new State Council of 15 members elected by proportional representation by
all members.

* Branches with – in practice – a largely unchanged role, but with the capacity to
  determine their own internal administrative structure.

* Mandatory participatory and deliberative processes for members to establish
  policies and the party strategy.

* Regular all-member forums.

* Mandatory and specific affirmative action provisions, and a guaranteed right of
  participation for First Nations members at the top level of the Party.

* A much shorter and simpler document than we have now, leaving much more
  for party bodies and members to determine as needs arise.

* A system under which members who are unhappy with a decision (or non-
  decision) by the State Council can, through their branches, initiate a discussion
  of that issue involving all members, aimed at developing consensus, and in
  certain circumstances having the issue resolved by a vote of all members.

* A Constitutional Votes Committee responsible for the integrity of elections and
  for member votes under the Constitution.
