<u>Summary and Explanation</u>

Part 5 provides for a membership application process and membership fees (clauses
30 and 32). It also provides, as required by the relevant legislation, that State Council
must establish a procedure to deal with grievances ([clause 33](#grievance-procedure)) and for disciplinary
action ([clause 34](#disciplinary-action)).

It is important to note that the relevant legislation provides that any grievance against
the State Council cannot be dealt with by the State Council itself.
