    1. An ‘applicant’ for AGV membership is a natural person whose membership application and fee
    has been received by the AGV.

    2. An individual may apply for AGV membership by paying the applicable membership fee and by completing and submitting the membership application form which will contain, but is not limited to, the following information:

        <subclause-letters>

        1. the name of the applicant;

        2. the residential address, including postcode, of the applicant;

        3. the postal address of the applicant, as well as the phone, fax, email or other electronic contacts;
    
        4. A declaration signed by the applicant that they agree to be bound by the Charter and
        constitutional rules of the Greens;

        5. A declaration signed by the applicant that the applicant is not a member of any other
        political party or its subordinate bodies and will not join such organisations whilst
        remaining an AGV Member (see clause 7.5(c)).

        </subclause-letters>

    3. The following bodies will have the power to admit an applicant as a Member:

        <subclause-letters>

        1. A Branch covering the area where the Member resides;

        2. The State Council or State Executive in respect of any application from an applicant where
        there is no relevant Branch; and

        3. The State Council or State Executive in respect of any application from an applicant where
        the relevant Branch has been aware of but failed to consider an application for at least35. 
        days.
        Provided that should the relevant Branch or the State Executive at any time resolve that any
        person’s application should be deferred for further consideration, or rejected, then no body (other
        than the body which resolved to defer or reject the application) may later admit that person to
        membership and no admission to membership made in error shall be valid. This shall not limit
        State Council’s right to admit a person to membership.

        </subclause-letters>
    
    4. Each application will be processed according to any bylaws formulated by the State Council.

    5. An applicant will be welcomed as a new AGV Member, provided that person:

        <subclause-letters>
    
        1. has read and agreed to the Charter and agreed to abide by the constitutional rules of the
        AGV;

        2. agrees to join the AGV and to be registered to a Branch (where one is established which
        covers the applicant) according to residential address;

        3. is not a member of a proscribed organisation, and agrees to refrain from joining a
        proscribed organisation whilst remaining an AGV Member;

        4. pays an annual membership fee;

        5. complies, if applicable, with clause 56.16;

        6. acknowledges and agrees that certain personal information collected by the AGV may be
        provided to State and Federal electoral authorities in accordance with legislative
        requirements;

        7. acknowledges and agrees that their personal information may be passed on to the
        Australian Greens; and
        
        8. is approved for membership by a Party body in accordance with 7.3.

        </subclause-letters>
    
    6. Notwithstanding 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, a person who is a financial member of a political party which
    is a member party of the Australian Greens other than the AGV (the ‘other party’) may, if they
    have moved to the State of Victoria or will imminently do so, request membership of the AGV.
    In such circumstances, the State Secretary or person appointed by the State Secretary may admit
    the person as a Member, provided that the information listed at 7.21. to (e), and any prescribed
    fee, has been provided either by the person or the other party, and provided that membership of
    the person to the other party ceases upon the person’s admission to the AGV. Where any doubt
    arises as to whether the admission of a person under this clause is appropriate, the matter may be
    referred to the State Executive for decision.
