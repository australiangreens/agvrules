See also box under [Part 3](./03-state-council.md).

State Council procedure is set out in Schedule 5. The quorum is increased from the
current one-third of State Council to one-half of the current members (Schedule 5,
[item 3](#quorum)).

As well as reconsideration proposals by branches (discussed above), there are two
types of proposal which can be put to State Council:

* procedural proposals (about how the meeting runs) which require a simple
  majority (50% +1) to pass, and

* substantive proposals which can only be put to a vote if the discussion has
  failed to reach consensus and the matter should not be deferred. When this is
  the case, the proposal is carried if the proposal is supported by both two thirds
  of those who vote, and at least half of the membership of State Council. This
  contrasts with the current procedure for State Council which is that 75% must
  first vote in favour of putting a substantive proposal to a vote and then the
  substantive proposal is carried if 75% of those voting vote in favour. There is
  currently no minimum requirement for the absolute number of votes in favour.

A State Councillor may make another State Councillor their proxy, but only during two
periods totalling 5 weeks in a year (Schedule 5, [item 5](#proxies)). This allows State Councillors
to take approximately one month of leave from their State Council duties each year.

        before or during its effective period, by written notice given
        to State Council.

    4.  Each State Councillor, in each financial year, may appoint:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  one proxy for a specified period of up to five weeks; or

        2.  two proxies, who may be different State Councillors, for two
            specified, non‑overlapping periods of up to five weeks in
            total.

        </subclause-letters>

    5.  A State Councillor may only be the proxy of one other State
        Councillor at a time.

        members in attendance at a State Council meeting keep the
        contents of all or any part of that meeting confidential from
        other members.

    4.  State Council must not limit the entitlement of a State
        Councillor, or a member appointed under sub‑item (1) or (2), to
        attend a State Council meeting.

7. ## Additional procedures

    State Council may, by a substantive proposal, make additional meeting
    procedures that are consistent with these procedures.
