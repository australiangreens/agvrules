title: Chapter 5 — Electoral Processes
---

52. ## Overview

    1. The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate the formation, adoption and management of processes
    for electoral and continuous campaigning for the political purposes of the AGV. State Council
    may make bylaws to facilitate any element of the processes outlined hereunder.

    2. Although Branches are recognised as the primary organising unit for election purposes, this
    Constitution authorises the creation of regional campaign committees based on such boundaries
    as State Council may determine, to facilitate election management and continuous campaigning
    where they are best managed across more than one Branch or group of Branches.

    3. To facilitate the management of electoral and continuous campaigning on a state-wide basis, this
    Constitution authorises the creation of a Standing Committee of State Council for electoral and
    continuous campaigning purposes.

    4. State electoral and continuous campaigning policies will be formulated with the maximum
    participation of AGV Members and Branches through the meeting procedures outlined in
    chapter 3.6, and must actively consider input from relevant expert persons or bodies, including
    that provided by the national office of the Party and any elected Greens public official.

53. ## The Victorian Campaign Committee

    1. Reporting to State Council, the formulation of state-wide AGV electoral and continuous
    campaigning policy and the management of its application will be the responsibility of the
    Victorian Campaign Committee created as a Standing Committee of State Council under this
    Chapter.

    2. The Victorian Campaign Committee is responsible for:


    1. developing electoral and continuous campaigning policy with state-wide cover for local
    government and state parliamentary elections, and managing such campaigns;

    2. liaising with regional campaign committees and Branches to facilitate the goals of this
    Chapter;

    3. collaborating with relevant Party bodies to develop national electoral and continuous
    campaigning policy;

    4. reporting to State Council on all other matters referred to it by State Council; and
    5. any other electoral or continuous campaigning related functions given to it by State
    Council or under the bylaws.

    3. The Victorian Campaign Committee will establish a Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) in
    accordance with section50. .

54. ## The Victorian Campaign Committee Convenor

    1. The Convenor of the Victorian Campaign Committee will be elected by all AGV Members by
    annual postal or electronic ballot (though if the position remains unfilled after the annual postal
    or electronic ballot for any reason, that position may be elected by all AGV Members present at
    the Annual Conference or at a Special State Conference by consensus or, failing this consensus,
    by a secret ballot of all AGV Members present), and will be a voting member of the State



    Executive and State Council. An individual who has served two consecutive terms as Convenor
    will not be eligible for re-election at the next election (but will in any case be eligible for
    subsequent elections), unless this provision is waived by consensus decision of State Council.

    2. The position of Convenor of the Victorian Campaign Committee may be held on a job-share
    basis, in which case clauses15. .5,15. .6 and15. .7 shall apply as though ‘Office Bearers’ means
    ‘Convenors of the Victorian Campaign Committee’ and ‘Executive’ means ‘Victorian Campaign
    Committee’, and clause 15.9 will also apply.

    3. The Convenor of the Victorian Campaign Committee will:


    1. be responsible for managing the meetings, agenda and responsibilities of the committee in
    a way which facilitates the effective delivery of the electoral and continuous campaigning
    objectives of the AGV;

    2. convene urgent meetings of the committee’s Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) as
    required to address urgent and pressing electoral and continuous campaigning related
    matters;

    3. attend whenever possible all meetings of the State Executive, to ensure electoral and
    continuous campaigning considerations are taken into account in all State Executive
    decisions;

    4. regularly report to the State Executive and State Council on the normal business of the
    committee, and refer committee recommendations to the State Executive and State Council
    for decision on actions where appropriate;

    5. liaise with any elected public officials, and facilitate their involvement in the Victorian
    Campaign Committee processes;

    6. confer with the AGV body given responsibility for national electoral and continuous
    campaigning matters;

    7. perform any other function required by State Council or the bylaws.

    55 Electorate Campaigns

    1. For any Local Government election in which the AGV will be supporting a candidate (subject to
    Schedule 1 where there is more than one Branch in a Local Government Area), the campaign
    will be directed by the relevant Branch, or a campaign committee established by that Branch.

    2. For any Victorian Legislative Assembly or Federal House of Representatives election in which
    the AGV will be supporting a candidate, the campaign for each electorate will be directed by a
    Branch with coverage within the bounds of the electorate, or a campaign committee established
    by the Branch.

    3. For any Victorian Legislative Council election in which the AGV will be supporting a candidate,
    the campaign for each electorate will be directed by a regional campaign committee if one has
    been established by State Council, or by the Victorian Campaign Committee if no regional
    campaign committee has been established.

    4. For any Federal Senate election in which the AGV will be supporting a candidate, the campaign
    will be directed by the Victorian Campaign Committee.


    5. State Council may enact bylaws to further determine which Branch has jurisdiction in relation to
    2.; the powers, responsibilities, membership structures of campaign committees formed under
    clause 55.1,55. .2 or55. .3; and the direction of any campaign where either no responsible body
    exists, or the responsible body declines to direct the campaign.

    6. All Branches or campaign committees responsible for the direction of the campaign in an
    electorate, will:
    1. appoint a campaign co-ordinator (which may be an Office Bearer or any other committee
    member), and authorise the coordinator to expend funds up to a specified limit;

    2. provide all necessary information to the State Convenor, Secretary and Treasurer, the Party
    Agent and the Registered Officer for the purposes of compliance with the relevant
    Commonwealth or Victorian legislation; and
    3. keep their own separate set of record books and where required to do so furnish the
    relevant Electoral Commission with accurate financial records for them to check. The
    following must also be recorded separately:
    9. all gifts as defined in the relevant legislation;

    (ii) records of election expenses; and
    (iii) claims for reimbursement of electoral expenses up to the amount allowed, if
    applicable.

    7. Financial records relating to election campaign expenses will be kept for five years following the
    election to which they relate.

    8. A campaign committee may be suspended by:


    1. a decision of the entity that created it; or
    2. by a decision of State Council if there is evidence that the committee is seriously failing to
    meet its Constitutional or financial responsibilities or persistently breaches State Council
    decisions;


    9. If a campaign committee is dissolved or suspended under clause 55.8, the direction of the
    campaign will transfer to the body otherwise responsible under clauses55. .1 to55. .3 if there is
    one, or to the Victorian Campaign Committee if there is not, for the duration of the suspension.

56. ## Pre-selection and Endorsement

    1. State Council may enact bylaws to determine the method to be used for pre-selecting candidates
    to stand for any election as an endorsed AGV candidate. In lieu of any bylaws, State Council
    will, in good time before each general election for federal parliament, state parliament and local
    government, determine the method to be used for pre-selecting candidates to stand at that
    election as an endorsed AGV candidate. In either case, State Council may determine different
    methods for individual electorates or positions on a ticket in a given election, such as
    differentiating between targeted electorates or lead candidates and other electorates or
    candidates, and the determined method or methods must be used consistently by all Party bodies
    in Victoria responsible for conducting pre-selections for that election.


    2. In the event that State Council has not specified a method under clause 56.1, the default pre-
    selection method for all electorates and candidates will be an electronic or postal ballot of all
    AGV Members living within the corresponding electorate.

    3. The body with responsibility for directing the campaigns under section55.  of the Constitution,
    will determine the method of preselection in accordance with any decisions of State Council
    under clause 56.1.

    4. Where a relevant election campaign committee exists, the campaign committee will conduct the
    preselection, otherwise the body with responsibility for directing the campaign will conduct the
    preselection.

    5. If there is no Branch or election campaign committee covering a given electorate, or the relevant
    Branch or election campaign committee reports that it is unable or unwilling to conduct the pre-
    selection, the State Council may designate another body to conduct the pre-selection for that
    electorate.

    6. State Council may determine a date by which a particular class of pre-selections must occur, and
    in default of this, may determine any other necessary matter regarding the conduct of pre-
    selections.

    7. If there is only one candidate for election for public office, endorsement will nevertheless be
    required in accordance with the procedure established under clause 56.1, conducted by the
    relevant body specified in clause 56.3.

    8. In the case of a casual vacancy in an office previously held by an endorsed AGV office holder in
    the Federal Senate, the Victorian Legislative Council or any other body for which a casual
    vacancy requires the AGV to nominate a replacement office holder, a new pre-selection must be
    held. The rules in this section will apply as if the pre-selection for the casual vacancy were a
    general election to that body.

    9. In the case of a by-election, the State Council will determine a method for pre-selecting
    candidates and determine which body will be responsible for conducting the pre-selection.

    10. In exceptional circumstances State Council may exercise a veto option on candidates proposed
    by a Branch or an election campaign committee. A veto must be supported by75.  per cent of the
    State Council, which may then propose a new candidate if the relevant Branch or election
    campaign committee does not opt to do so.

    11. All approved candidates must be AGV Members.

    12. Candidates for public office who have been pre-selected under section56.  will be recognised as
    endorsed candidates of the Greens.

    13. Sitting parliamentarians and local government representatives will also go through the candidate
    selection process before each relevant election.

    14. No AGV Member will nominate or stand for election in any local government, or State or
    Federal parliament other than as an endorsed candidate of the AGV, unless approved by State
    Council.

    15. A Member must not be in breach of clause 56.1 4 at the close of nominations.

    16. Any person who applies for AGV membership while standing for election to, or after having
    been elected to, any local government, or State or Federal parliament will require:



    1. acceptance as an AGV Member, and
    2. endorsement pursuant to the pre-selection process set out in clause 56, and
    3. endorsement by State Council.

    17. A Member who is elected to Public Office on a countback and who was not endorsed by the
    Party to be a candidate for that Public Office must immediately notify State Council by giving
    written notice to the State Secretary. If State Council does not endorse that member for that
    Public Office within 3 months of them taking that Public Office, or if State Council decides that
    the member is not endorsed, that member must either resign that Public Office or resign their
    Party membership.

    18. Nothing in this section or in any bylaw made thereunder, conducted by the relevant body
    specified in clause 56.3, shall be taken as preventing any measure which is deemed necessary to
    ensure that the AGV or Australian Greens has a candidate in any seat in any State or Federal
    election in circumstances where any present or future preselection process which would
    otherwise apply cannot or would not be completed due to the calling of an early election at short
    notice.

57. ## Allocation of Preferences

    1. The decision on the allocation of preferences for local government electorates may be made by
    Branches, subject to Schedule 1 where there is more than one Branch in a Local Government
    Area. If there is any ambiguity as to whether a Branch has authority in a particular case, the
    dispute will be resolved by the State Council.

    2. Any Branch may delegate the responsibility for deciding preference allocation to State Council.

    3. The decision on the allocation of preferences for any electorate that is not a local government
    municipality will be made by State Council or the body to which State Council delegates that
    power, having consulted with the Branches to which the electorate corresponds.
