title: Chapter 9 — Administrative Review
---

82. ## Definitions

    1. In this chapter:


    1. decision includes:
    9. a failure or refusal to make a decision; and
    (ii) an action.

83. ## Procedure

    1. A member or former member expelled under clause 91.2 (the applicant) may apply to, and only
    to, the Administrative Review Panel for a finding that a decision of a member or party body
    (other than the Administrative Review Panel):
    1. did not comply with this Constitution or the bylaws; or



    2. was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have made it.

    2. An application may be made about multiple decisions.

    3. A member must not make an application in bad faith.

    4. Members of the Administrative Review Panel who are biased must not be present during the
    consideration and resolution of the application.

    5. A member involved in an application may appoint any person to act on their behalf for the
    purposes of the application.

    6. In dealing with an application, the Administrative Review Panel:


    1. may:
    9. inform itself in any way it deems appropriate, including by obtaining expert advice
    from a non-member; and
    (ii) direct a member to truthfully answer its questions in person or in writing;

    2. may, at any time, after giving brief reasons in writing for doing so, dismiss so much of an
    application that it decides:
    9. does not concern the exercise of the power of the AGV;

    (ii) is not serious enough to warrant its consideration; or
    (iii) has been dealt with by one or more of its previous decisions.
    3. subject to clause 83.6(b), must:
    9. give notice in writing of the substance of the application and a reasonable
    opportunity to make a written and oral submission on the matter to:
    1. the applicant; and
    2. those members and party bodies that it decides ought to be heard in respect of
    the application, given the issues involved;

    (ii) decide whether or not to make one of the findings in clause 83.1;

    (iii) state that decision, and give brief reasons for it, in writing; and
    (iv) if it makes one of the findings in clause 83.1, decide whether to grant a remedy
    aimed at rectifying, in whole or in part:
    1. the decision; and
    2. any consequences that flowed from it.

    7. Subject to clause 76.5, in making a decision under clause 83.6(c)(ii), the Administrative Review
    Panel must, by necessity, interpret this Constitution, the bylaws, the National Constitution and
    any bylaws made under the National Constitution but only to the extent that it is necessary to do
    so to deal with an application. Such interpretations are authoritative unless and until they are
    expressly overturned by the Administrative Review Panel or by State Council under clause 76.5.

    8. A remedy granted under clause 83.6(c)(iv) may include:


    1. setting a decision aside;

    2. making a decision that plainly should have been made; and



    3. declaring that a member is elected or appointed to a party office or party body or
    preselected as a candidate in an external election.

    9. If, having dismissed an application, the Administrative Review Panel decides that the application
    may have been made in bad faith, a member of the Administrative Review Panel may make a
    misconduct allegation under clause 87.1 against the applicant.
