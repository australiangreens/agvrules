<u>Summary and Explanation</u>

This part largely reflects the current arrangements, with the exception that some of the
administrative and office-bearer requirements in the current Constitution have been
removed. For example, a small branch might choose to have only a
Convenor/Secretary, or a ‘Coordinator’, rather than having the full suite of office bearer
positions.

State Council retains the power to establish and disestablish branches but would now
require the agreement of the relevant branches to redefine a branch area. The default
position is that a branch must be defined by local government boundaries (clause 7(4)
(c)).

Clause 8 defines branch membership, which is essentially unchanged but is clarified.

Clause 9 sets out the powers of branches, including powers to make local policies and
engage with the community. Branch decisions are subject to contrary State Council
decisions, and State Council may, but only temporarily, suspend the power of a branch
to make public statements.

Clause 12 adds a new power for branches to formally submit a question to State
Council and receive an answer within 60 days.

Clause 13 creates new powers for branches to propose a reconsideration proposal – to
propose to State Council that it rescind a State Council or senior party body decision
they don’t like. A branch can also forward a substantive proposal. If they do this, State
Council must consider what they have put forward, and if State Council does not agree,
it must explain why in writing. State Council can adopt a reconsideration proposal by a
simple majority.

An example of a reconsideration-proposal in practice is:

<subclause-letters>

1. State Council decides by consensus in June to establish a Committee on Rural Policy;

2. North-East Victoria Branch moves a reconsideration proposal in July because it thinks its voice was not
   heard, and this new Committee will undermine the role of the Country Greens Network;

3. State Council, at its August meeting is divided, but votes 8 to 7 in favour of
  rescinding its earlier decision so it can consider the matter further;
  
4. any further decision is made in the ordinary way.

</subclause-letters>

This makes it easier for branches to have the State Council reconsider a matter when it
may not have heard directly from a branch at an earlier meeting.

Clause 16 allows the State Council to suspend a branch, but only in exceptional
circumstances and only for 60 days.

    Clause 13 creates new powers for branches to propose a reconsideration proposal – to
    propose to State Council that it rescind a State Council or senior party body decision
    they don’t like. A branch can also forward a substantive proposal. If they do this, State
    Council must consider what they have put forward, and if State Council does not agree,
    it must explain why in writing. State Council can adopt a reconsideration proposal by a
    simple majority.

    <subclause-letters>

    1. State Council decides by consensus in June to establish a Committee on Rural Policy;

    2. North-East Victoria Branch moves a reconsideration proposal in July because it thinks its voice was not
    heard, and this new Committee will undermine the role of the Country Greens Network;

    3. State Council, at its August meeting is divided, but votes 8 to 7 in favour of
    rescinding its earlier decision so it can consider the matter further;
    
    4. any further decision is made in the ordinary way.

    </subclause-letters>

    This makes it easier for branches to have the State Council reconsider a matter when it
    may not have heard directly from a branch at an earlier meeting.
    </details>

    1.  A branch may submit to State Council:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  a reconsideration proposal; or

        2.  a substantive proposal.

        </subclause-letters>

    2.  A reconsideration proposal must be submitted to State Council no
        later than 60 days after the resolution to which it relates was
        made.

        must:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  decide whether to pass the proposal; and

        2.  if the proposal is not passed—explain in writing why it did
            not pass.

        </subclause-letters>

14. ## Joint branch proposal to State Council

    <details><summary>Drafting Panel commentary</summary>
    Clause 2 on policy requires that party policy and the party strategy generally only be made by members through a participatory process, by consensus (or a 75% vote) of members participating. State Council can make a policy or the party strategy in urgent circumstances. The clause also reflects our existing hierarchy of national, state and local policies.
    </details>

    A joint branch proposal to State Council may be submitted in accordance
    with Schedule 2.

15. ## Members’ direct decision-making

    1.  The members’ direct decision-making procedure is in Schedule 3.

        contradicted or undermined, except where State Council decides
        that:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  it is illegal, or has involved or will involve the Party in
            illegality;

        2.  it will cause the Party to become insolvent or has created
            or will create a substantial risk that the Party will become
            insolvent; or

        3.  exceptional circumstances justify otherwise.

        </subclause-letters>

16. ## Suspension

    <details><summary>Drafting Panel commentary</summary>
