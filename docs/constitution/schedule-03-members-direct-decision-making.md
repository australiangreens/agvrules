(duplicate of Schedule 2 commentary)

<u>At a glance</u>

* Sets out the procedure for making a joint branch proposal leading to a possible
  members’ meeting and members’ plebiscite.

* Sets out the procedure for members’ direct decision-making meetings and
  members’ plebiscites.

* Aims to ensure that the State Council cannot act (or fail to act) in a manner
  which is clearly against the will of the membership.

<u>Summary and Explanation</u>

This part of the Constitution sets out what happens if members are unhappy with a
decision (or non-decision) of State Council and want to have the decision made by the
membership instead. The proposal cannot go forward if it deals with certain limited
matters set out in [Schedule 2, item 2](./schedule-02-joint-branch-proposal-to-state-council.md#permitted-proposals-and-issues) (e.g. to employ or not employ or dismiss a
particular person, or to buy real estate).

This procedure is best explained by an example. Example: if some members were
opposed to a $25,000 cut in our contributions to the Australian Greens, as decided by
State Council, what could they do?

1. They could get three of our branches to each adopt a resolution proposing to
  reverse the cut ([Schedule 2, item 1](./schedule-02-joint-branch-proposal-to-state-council.md#submitting)) and appoint a delegate of the branch.

2. State Council would then have to decide whether or not to agree with what the
  three branches proposed ([Schedule 2, item 3](./schedule-02-joint-branch-proposal-to-state-council.md#state-council-decision)). If State Council did what they
  wanted, that would be the end of the process.

3. If the State Council did not agree to what the three branches wanted, the three
  delegates of the three Branches could require that a members’ meeting be
  called ([Schedule 2, item 4](./schedule-02-joint-branch-proposal-to-state-council.md#branch-delegates-decision)).

4. The issue and the proposal of the three branches then goes to a meeting open
  to all members ([Schedule 3, Item 2](#members-meeting)) . The quorum is 50 members, and if that is
  not reached, the matter goes to another meeting (i.e. a second attempt) within
  14 days. The purpose of the meeting is to attempt to develop a consensus
  resolution of the issue. If that consensus is reached, the decision binds the
  Party. For example, there might be consensus that a cut of only $10,000 to our
  contribution will apply.

5. The meeting can decide a number of things if consensus cannot be reached, or
  if members decide to deal with the matter in particular ways ([Schedule 3, Item 2](#members-meeting)). These include:

  <subclause-letters>

    1. The members might think the matter had no merit or should not go further –
    two thirds present and voting can vote to stop further consideration of the
    matter.

    2. Members could decide to convene another meeting to consider the issue
    further – a majority present and voting could vote to do this.

    3. The members could decide to adopt a (non-binding) resolution – requiring a
    two-thirds majority and 67 in favour (e.g., ‘this meeting recommends to
    State Council that the cut in contributions be reversed next financial year’).

    4. Members could vote to hold a members’ plebiscite on a question, but only if
    there were enough members who wanted this. Therefore, this would need
    two-thirds to vote in favour but also at least 67 members in favour.

  </subclause-letters>

6. If the members’ meeting cannot reach consensus, and the meeting decides to
    send a proposal to a members’ plebiscite, then subject to various procedural
    requirements, the proposal is sent to all branches, and members get to vote, as
    individuals, if they have attended their branch meeting or another meeting held
    by the Constitutional Votes Committee to consider the merits of the proposal.
    Proposals are not carried unless at least:

    <subclause-letters>

    1. 60% of members vote in favour, and

    2. the number of votes in favour exceeds the number opposed by at least 3%
    of the membership (currently around 125)—

    3. however, the vote fails if a majority of members voting in a majority of
    branches vote against.

    </subclause-letters>

7. If a proposal is carried, it is binding upon the State Council for 1 year.

    available to members.


3. ## Members’ plebiscite

    1.  <ClauseAnnotation days /> If a plebiscite is initiated on a proposal different from the
        joint branch proposal, the three branch delegates may, within
        seven days, by unanimous agreement, decide that the joint branch
        proposal must also be included (***double plebiscite***).

    2.  In the case of a double plebiscite, the Committee must decide
        whether:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  the two proposals are independent of each other; or

        2.  one proposal is an alternative (***alternative proposal***)
            to the other (***primary proposal***).

        </subclause-letters>

    3.  A plebiscite must be conducted in accordance with the following
        principles:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  freedom of debate and truthful communication;

        2.  informed voting; and

        3.  substantial compliance is sufficient compliance.

        </subclause-letters>

    4.  If a plebiscite is initiated, the Committee must:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  give each member a document that sets out:

            1.  the issue and the proposal(s);

            2.  the financial implications (if any) of the proposal(s)
                being passed;

            3.  arguments provided by members in favour of the
                proposal(s);

            4.  arguments provided by members against the proposal(s);
                and

            5.  State Council’s position (if any) regarding the
                proposal(s); and

        2.  make reasonable efforts to see that each branch arranges for
            the proposal(s) to be properly considered and voted on.

        </subclause-letters>

    5.  Arguments under sub-item (4)(a) must not be attributed to an
        author.

    6.  <ClauseAnnotation days /> Within 60 days after each member is given the document in
        sub-item (4)(a):

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  each branch must arrange for its members to consider and
            vote on the proposal(s) by show of hands and advise the
            Committee in writing of the results of the vote(s); and

        2.  the Committee must convene at least five meetings for
            members to consider and vote on the proposal(s) by show of
            hands.

        </subclause-letters>

    7.  Each member may vote in a plebiscite only once.

    8.  The failure of a branch to arrange for its members to consider
        and vote on the proposal(s) does not, alone, invalidate a
        plebiscite.

    9.  A proposal is passed if the following criteria are satisfied:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  at least 60% of the votes are in favour;

        2.  the votes in favour exceed the votes against by at least 3%
            of the whole membership;

        3.  it is not the case that a majority of members at a majority
            of branch meetings in which votes were cast voted against
            the proposal; and

        4.  where the proposal in question is the alternative proposal
            in a double plebiscite—the primary proposal was not passed.

        </subclause-letters>

    10. The Committee must:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  declare whether each proposal (***members’ plebiscite
            proposal***) was passed; and

        2.  make the results of the vote(s), generally and broken down
            by branch and other meetings, available to members.

        </subclause-letters>

    11. <ClauseAnnotation nodelegate /> State Council must remove a proposal from a plebiscite if:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  it is not a permitted proposal about the issue;

        2.  it would, if passed, be illegal or involve the Party in
            illegality; or

        3.  it would, if passed, cause the Party to become insolvent or
            create a substantial risk that the Party will become
            insolvent.

        </subclause-letters>

    12. The Committee may, after hearing from the branch delegates and
        State Council, terminate a plebiscite or remove a proposal from
        a plebiscite if it considers that it has been rendered
        redundant.
