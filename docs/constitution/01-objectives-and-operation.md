    2. This Constitution identifies the principles and rules governing the conduct of the AGV affairs
    and defines the powers of the constituent groups and the roles of the positions defined within.

    3. All other AGV documents are subordinate to this Constitution with the exception of the Charter.

    4. The Constitution seeks to maximise opportunities for productive cooperation between AGV
    Members and to provide protection for individual AGV Members and constituent groups.

    5. The Constitution requires the constituent groups of the AGV to:

        <subclause-letters>

        1. agree to the Charter of the Greens, and to abide by this Constitution as well as to the
        National Constitution of the Australian Greens, and to the proper decisions of the National
        Organisation; and

        2. support affirmative action and practise participatory, democratic and accountable internal
        decision-making processes.

        </subclause-letters>

    6. The Constitution further requires that the AGV and all its constituent groups have autonomy to
    make decisions relating to their own affairs, provided that these decisions remain compatible
    with the Constitution, the Charter and the agreed policy frameworks of the Greens.

2. ## The Charter of the Greens

    1. The Charter is the basic document of agreement which defines the principles and aims of the
    Australian Greens. As such, AGV Members and constituent groups should not publicly forward

    and status within, the AGV.

    eligible members of the Australian Greens nationwide. For the result of such a plebiscite to be
    valid, at least51.  per cent of members of the Australian Greens must have participated.

          participatory democracy and ecological sustainability;

          2. to make, publicise and strive to implement policies on national and global issues as
          described in the Charter;

          3. to engage in education of both ourselves and the rest of the community, to raise awareness
          of the issues and concerns covered in the Charter;

          4. to promote and assist other individuals, associations, organisations and community
          networks, working for the objectives of the Greens;

          5. to promote the development of and participate and communicate with the Green political
          movement both nationally and globally;

          6. to be a registered political party pursuant to the Commonwealth and Victorian Electoral
          Acts;

          Charter, principles, policies and objectives of the Greens;

          8. to encourage other political parties to adopt our policies and principles by electoral
          strategies and direction of voting preferences;

          9. to coordinate mutual support and joint actions on behalf of Greens Party Members;

          10. to carry out such tasks as the membership may from time to time delegate to the State body.

4. ## National and State Greens Parties
