4. ## Decision-making

    <details><summary>Drafting Panel commentary</summary>

    Clause 4 introduces a new requirement that all decisions must be made in pursuit of
    the party’s purposes (clause 4(1)). The clause sets out, in a more mandatory way than
    in our current Constitution, the principles of consensus decision-making (clause 4(2) &
    (4)). This clause also sets out new principles for the delegation of decision-making
    (clause 4(3)).

    </details>

    1.  Each decision of the Party must be made in pursuit of the
        purposes of the Party.

    2.  Each party meeting must be conducted in accordance with the
        following principles:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  participants should come with a commitment to reaching
            consensus and in a spirit of collaboration and collective
            responsibility;

        2.  meaningful participation should be fostered by all
            participants;

        3.  the expression of diverse views should be encouraged;

        4.  enough time should be devoted to allow sufficient
            deliberation; and

        5.  a properly made decision should be accepted by all.

        </subclause-letters>

    3.  Each decision to delegate power must be made by balancing the
        following principles:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  the meaningful participation of members is valuable for its
            own sake;

        2.  a decision with local effects should be made at the local
            level;

        3.  decisions should be high-quality, strategic and effective;
            and

        4.  decisions should be made efficiently.

        </subclause-letters>

    4.  A substantive proposal may only be put to a vote if every effort
        has been made to reach consensus and the decision should not be
        deferred.

5. ## Openness

    <details><summary>Drafting Panel commentary</summary>
    Clause 5 sets out the entitlement of members to attend meetings, establishes a new requirement that meetings be accessible to all members and that members have a reasonable right to communicate with all other members. This clause also provides for members’ forums to be held twice a year to discuss issues raised by members (clause 5(4)).
    </details>

    1.  Each member is entitled to attend the meetings of each party
        body, except where:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  the decision that establishes the party body provides
            otherwise;

        2.  the party body limits that entitlement by a procedural
            proposal; or

        3.  in exceptional circumstances, State Council temporarily
            limits the entitlement of a particular member.

        </subclause-letters>

    2.  Party meetings and events must be made as accessible to members
        as reasonably practicable, including by providing, where
        appropriate, a range of times and locations and an option to
        attend virtually.

    3.  Each member is entitled, to a reasonable extent, to communicate
        with the whole membership about party matters through party
        communications and publications.

    4.  At least twice each year, State Council must convene a members’
        forum, to which each member is invited, at which:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  it reports on its work and the affairs of the Party;

        2.  it seeks members’ views about important matters, including
            party governance, the party budget, election campaign
            strategy, and the Australian Greens;

        3.  it answers members’ questions; and

        4.  issues raised by members are discussed.

        </subclause-letters>

6. ## Affirmative action

    <details><summary>Drafting Panel commentary</summary>
    Clause 6 establishes an additional strengthened mandatory obligation on the Party to implement affirmative action measures for underrepresented groups. However, this does not affect the election process for the State Council.
    </details>

    1.  The Party must:

        <subclause-letters>

        1.  implement affirmative action to achieve equity for
            underrepresented groups; and

        2.  take special measures to increase representation for
            underrepresented groups across the overall membership of the
            following groups: State Councillors, members of senior party
            bodies, candidates for public office and members who hold
            public office.

        </subclause-letters>

    2.  A special measure must not be inconsistent with Schedules 6, 7 and 8.
