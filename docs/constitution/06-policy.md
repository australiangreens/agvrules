title: Chapter 6 — Policy
---

58. ## Overview

    1. The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate the formation and drafting of policy for the political
    purposes of the AGV. State Council may make bylaws to facilitate any element of the policy
    process outlined hereunder.

    2. Given that policy is particularly scrutinised during an electoral campaign, it will normally be
    reviewed or developed in the period between elections. Reviews of current policies and
    development of new policies may be initiated by decision of State Council or by a petition
    supported by the signatures of at least 1 per cent or50. , whichever is the lesser, of AGV
    members.

    3. Policies which concern only one Branch area or region may be decided by an authorised Branch
    or Regional Council responsible for that area, and must be consistent with state policy. Copies of
    all policies adopted by a Branch or Regional Council will be forwarded immediately to the State
    Secretary and to the convenor of the Policy Steering Committee.

    4. State policies will be formulated with the maximum participation of the AGV Members through
    the meeting procedures outlined in chapter 3.6, and should actively consider input from relevant



    expert persons or bodies, including those external to the Party, and that provided by any elected
    Greens public official.

59. ## The Policy Steering Committee

    1. The Policy Steering Committee is a Standing Committee of State Council. It is responsible to
    State Council for the formulation and drafting of AGV policy.

    2. The Policy Steering Committee is responsible for:


    1. management of the process of development and drafting of policy with state-wide cover;

    2. collaborating with the responsible Party bodies on the development and drafting of policy
    with national scope, for recommendation to State Council for consideration of the National
    Council of the Australian Greens in its policy approval process;

    3. reporting to State Council on all other matters referred to it by State Council; and
    4. any other policy-related functions given to it under the bylaws.

    3. The Policy Steering Committee will establish a Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) as
    specified in section50. .

60. ## The Policy Convenor

    1. The Convenor of the Policy Steering Committee will be elected by all AGV Members by annual
    postal or electronic ballot (though if the position remains unfilled after the annual postal or
    electronic ballot for any reason, that position may be elected by all AGV Members present at the
    Annual Conference or at a Special State Conference by consensus or, failing this consensus, by a
    secret ballot of all AGV Members present), and will be a voting member of the State Executive
    and State Council. An individual who has served two consecutive terms as Convenor will not be
    eligible for re-election at the next election (but will in any case be eligible for subsequent
    elections), unless this provision is waived by consensus decision of State Council.

    2. The position of Convenor of the Policy Steering Committee may be held on a job-share basis, in
    which case clauses15. .5,15. .6 and15. .7 shall apply as though ‘Office Bearers’ means ‘Convenors
    of the Policy Steering Committee’ and ‘Executive’ means ‘Policy Steering Committee’, and
    clause 15.9 will also apply.

    3. The Convenor of the Policy Steering Committee will:


    1. be responsible for managing the meetings, agenda and responsibilities of the Committee in
    a way which facilitates the effective delivery of the policy objectives of the AGV;

    2. convene urgent meetings of the Committee’s QDMG as required to address urgent and
    pressing policy-related matters;

    3. attend whenever possible all meetings of the State Executive, to ensure policy
    considerations are taken into account in all State Executive decisions;

    4. regularly report to the State Executive and State Council on the normal business of the
    Committee, and refer Committee recommendations to the State Executive and State
    Council for decision on actions where appropriate;

    5. liaise with any elected public officials, and facilitate their involvement in the policy
    formulation process;




    6. confer with the Party bodies given responsibility for formulating the AGV position on
    national policy matters; and
    7. perform any other function required by the bylaws.

61. ## Formulation of Policy

    1. Taking into account the advice of the Policy Steering Committee, State Council will make
    bylaws regulating the process to be undertaken in formulating AGV policy. The bylaws will
    include, but not be limited to:
    1. determining the establishment, role and responsibilities of working groups to develop
    specific policy areas;

    2. establishing a process which ensures adequate input into the policy process by AGV
    Members, Greens elected to public office and external experts; and
    3. establishing a process for reaching a consensus position (as far as that is possible) on draft
    policy which is developed for State Council approval.

62. ## Adoption of Policy

    1. Subject to the appropriate notice periods and other requirements specified below, AGV policy
    may be approved by a consensus decision of State Council, or by a75.  per cent majority vote of
    State Council, or by a75.  per cent majority vote of AGV Members by postal or electronic ballot.

    2. Where, at a State Council meeting, any policy or part of a policy is adopted, that policy will
    become official policy immediately.

    3. Notwithstanding clause 62.2, any whole or part of a policy or proposed policy will be subject to
    a postal or electronic ballot of Members if:
    1. State Council determines that the policy or proposed policy will be subject to a postal or
    electronic ballot; or
    2. within28.  days of consideration by State Council, 1 per cent or50.  (whichever is the lesser)
    of AGV Members request in writing to the State Secretary that the policy or proposed
    policy be subject to a postal or electronic ballot of AGV Members.

    4. The result of a postal or electronic ballot to determine policy will be conclusive provided that20. 
    per cent of the eligible AGV Members voted, and at least75.  per cent of the valid votes cast are
    in favour, and that policy will become official policy immediately.

    5. If a postal or electronic ballot is to be conducted under clause 62.3, State Council will determine
    what is put to the Members, including the question or questions that fairly represent the diversity
    of views that have been expressed by Members at the State Council or State Conference.

    6. Where such questions include policy proposals that are inconsistent in whole or in part with each
    other, and where both policies receive at least75.  per cent of the valid votes cast, the policy that
    obtains the greatest support will be adopted.

    7. The State Council will not make any policy decision which contradicts any current policy of the
    AGV approved by a ballot of AGV Members conducted as specified in clause 62.4, within the
    life of the current parliamentary or local government term.


63. ## Spokespersons

    1. The only persons with authority to make public statements on behalf of the AGV are:


    1. the Convenor of the AGV;

    2. spokespersons appointed by the State Council;

    3. AGV Members in public office with the endorsement of the AGV; and
