<u>Summary and Explanation</u>

The current State Council (which is the committee of management of the Party) has
some 70 odd members. Of these, 51 are elected one-per-branch, only at branch
meetings. Nine are appointed by State and Federal MPs and local councillors. Four
office bearers and the convenors of the Policy and Campaign Committees are elected
by all members. Finally, a number of positions are elected by members of the Upper
House regions with proportionately more members (presently Southern and Northern
Metro). There is also a State Executive (the office bearers, etc., plus 7 members
elected by and from State Council), all of whose decisions must be ratified by State
Council. Nearly all positions are elected annually.

It is proposed that this be replaced by a State Council with 15 members. All 15 would
be elected by proportional representation by the entire membership for a two-year
term, with 7 elected one year and 8 elected the next. Every second year there would be
an electronic vote of all members, and in the other years the election would be from all
members but with a requirement that members attend an election deliberation session
at a branch meeting or online before they can cast their ballot (see [Schedule 6](./schedule-06-state-council-elections.md)). This
vote does not need to be cast at the meeting. An election deliberation session is a
discussion of (see [Schedule 6, item 6](./schedule-06-state-council-elections.md#election-deliberation-session)):

<subclause-letters>

1. the issues facing the Party and how they should be addressed

2. the strengths and weaknesses of the current State Council; and

3. the merits of the candidates in addressing those.

</subclause-letters>

The new State Council would have all the powers of the current State Council, except
there would be a mandatory requirement for a participatory and deliberative
consensus-based decision-making process to be established for policy and high-level
strategy. Public office holders at each level of government have the right to appoint a
nominee to attend and speak at meetings of State Council, and they cannot be
excluded from any confidential session. The same rights of representation apply to the
Party’s First Nations members, with a right in the First Nations party body (i.e. the
BlakGreens) to nominate two members to attend any meeting of the State Council.
(Schedule 5, item 6(2)).

Clause 18 sets out the general powers of State Council. State Council must ensure that
the party has a party strategy and must establish party bodies and offices to assist it to
implement that strategy (clause 18(3)).

Clause 18(6) requires State Councillors to make themselves aware of the requirements
of party governance and to prioritise their State Council work over other party
responsibilities.

Clause 19 makes clear that State Council can delegate its powers to other bodies; for
example, to an election campaign management committee. However, [Schedule 4](./schedule-04-powers-state-council-must-not-delegate.md) sets
out a range of fundamental decisions that State Council cannot delegate.

Clause 22 sets out how a State Councillor ceases to hold office.
