# Confidential Information and In Camera Matters

1.  The AGV has a commitment to openness and transparency. However, the
    unauthorised disclosure of confidential information and in camera
    matters may harm the AGV. There are also serious legal, privacy,
    reputational and natural justice risks in sharing such matters. To
    avoid doubt, this bylaw confers no rights on persons who are not
    members of the AGV.

## Confidential Information

1.  For the purpose of this bylaw, “confidential”, in relation to any
    information, such as a record or document of any kind, means that
    access is only available to those persons:

    1.  who, are required in the execution of their duties as an
        authorised office- bearer of the AGV or its constituent groups
        or as a member of any appointed or elected Committee (including
        of any body established under these rules) to have such access;

    2.  who are required in the performance of their duties as a duly
        appointed or authorised employee or agent of the AGV to have
        such access;

    3.  who have been authorised to have access to that information by
        the office-bearer or the most senior staff member who has the
        care custody or control of such information;

    4.  who have access pursuant to a decision of the State Executive or
        the State Council;

    5.  who are investigating a relevant matter as a member of the
        Misconduct or Administrative Review Panels, or who are required
        to see such information as part of an effective investigation;
        and

    6.  to whom in all the circumstances the release is harmless and
        reasonable.

2.  Any constituent group may (subject to any contrary decision of State
    Council) determine that any information is confidential and limit
    access to a particular record or class of records to certain named
    persons or officers, but should do so only on reasonable grounds.

3.  Until and unless a decision is otherwise made under this bylaw, the
    following information is confidential:

    1.  minutes of and matters discussed in meetings held in camera;

    2.  records relating to the performance, selection, appointment or
        termination of individual staff;

    3.  records relating to litigation or potential litigation, or like
        dispute, where the release of such records might prejudice the
        position of the Party;

    4.  records relating to any commercial negotiation where the release
        of such records might prejudice the position of the Party;

    5.  records relating to any individual donation or like payment to
        the party, except as otherwise provided for in the bylaws;

    6.  any financial records of the organisation where the release of
        such records might prejudice the position of the Party;

    7.  any record or document provided on a bona fide confidential
        basis by a third party, but not where provision was primarily
        made in order to render the document confidential;

    8.  any document in relation to campaigning or an electoral matter
        whose value consists in its contents not being widely known;

    9.  any document whose release would be, in the opinion of the
        office-bearer or the most senior staff member having care
        custody or control of that record, highly prejudicial to the
        Party or unreasonably and unfairly damaging to a third party,
        provided that where access is denied to any member only on this
        ground and no other, the member seeking access may appeal to the
        next meeting of the State Executive, and shall have an
        opportunity to address the State Executive, in person or in
        writing, as to why access should be granted, and unless the
        State Executive confirms the denial, access will be granted;

    10. mediation or conciliation and any agreement entered into as a
        result of mediation or conciliation;

    11. complaints of bullying and harassment;

    12. complaints of sexual harassment;

    13. all aspects of a misconduct allegation, including the fact that
        it was made and any Notices of Decision;

    14. proceedings before the Endorsement Review Committee;

    15. nominations for Member Recognition Awards;

    16. deliberations of the Probity Panel; and

    17. records of nominations for preselection.

4.  Persons who receive confidential information of any kind must keep
    that information confidential.

5.  State Council may determine that any confidential information can be
    made available to party members or publicly.

6.  Where a member is authorised to release confidential information on
    a restricted basis, they must inform the people receiving the
    information that it should not be released more broadly without the
    express permission or instructions of State Council.

7.  Breaches of confidence may be referred to the Misconduct Panel and
    may result in a finding of misconduct.

## In Camera Matters

1.  In camera sessions are closed parts of meetings. At meetings of
    constituent groups consisting of elected representatives or
    delegates, a meeting may decide to go in camera and only members of
    the relevant constituent group are entitled to attend, but the group
    may also decide to invite specified non-members of the relevant
    group to attend.

2.  In camera sessions should be avoided. Meetings should only go in
    camera when absolutely necessary to maintain the confidentiality of
    matters discussed.

3.  If a meeting goes in camera, this shall be recorded in the minutes
    along with:

    1.  the general reason the meeting went in camera (identified to the
        level of ‘Staff Issue’, ‘Member Dispute’, ‘Campaign Strategy’,
        ‘Legal Issue’, or similar); and

    2.  the number of decisions made in camera.

4.  Any decisions made in camera shall be recorded in a separate set of
    in camera meeting minutes with sufficient information and documents
    to ensure it is clear what has been decided.

5.  In camera minutes of meetings shall not be available for viewing by
    anyone except the members of that group or of the State Executive,
    and such other persons the group or State Executive authorises.

6.  Any State Executive decisions made in camera shall be reported to
    State Council for ratification in accordance with the Constitution.
    State Executive may determine that this reporting shall occur at the
    next meeting of State Council, in writing or otherwise, rather than
    being included in the circulated minutes. However, the fact that
    such a report shall be given shall be included in the agenda of the
    relevant State Council meeting.

7.  Any decisions of another party body made in camera shall be reported
    to State Executive.

8.  State Council may decide to open in camera minutes of any
    constituent group for viewing by State Councillors at a State
    Council meeting, or by such members of State Council or the
    Misconduct or Administrative Review Panels, as it determines.
