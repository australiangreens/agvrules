# Standing Orders of State Council

Note: excerpts or descriptions of the State Constitution are shaded in
grey and are for reference only; such references do not themselves
constitute Standing Orders.

## Purpose

1.  The Standing Orders, along with the State Constitution, are the
    principal source of procedural authority for meetings of State
    Council. All meetings of State Council are to be conducted within
    the framework provided by these Standing Orders. Adherence to these
    Standing Orders is required for the proper conduct of State Council
    meetings.

## Agenda

The agenda is set by the State Secretary in line with the State
Constitution and by-laws.

1.  The agenda will specify the order and substance of matters for
    reporting or for debate.

2.  The agenda will include the full text of any and all Proposals (see
    Standing Orders: Proposals).

3.  The State Secretary may in framing the Agenda list a matter for
    “Discussion” or for “Formal Decision or Approval”. The agenda will
    include the words “For report only” or “Formal Decision or Approval”
    at agenda items where it is proposed that no discussion be entered
    into.

4.  The name of the facilitator for any and all parts of any State
    Council meeting will appear in the agenda. The facilitator will be
    the State Convenor, or appointee of the State Convenor.

5.  The agenda will specify that the beginning of each meeting will,
    before any substantive matters are discussed, include:

    1.  an acknowledgement of traditional landowners;

    2.  a reminder of the party’s Code of Conduct and complaints process
        and the contact person for that meeting;

    3.  a determination by the facilitator of whether or not the meeting
        is quorate (see Standing Orders: Quorum);

    4.  a declaration of observers;

    5.  a report of State Councillors absent with apologies;

    6.  the Proposal “that the proposed agenda and facilitators be
        agreed to”. To this Proposal, State Councillors may propose
        amendments to:

        1.  select different facilitators for any particular agenda
            item;

        2.  add agenda items;

        3.  add or delete the words “For report only” as appropriate to
            any part of the agenda;

        4.  move any items marked “For Formal Decision or Approval” to
            items for discussion; or

        5.  propose a variation to the time allocation;

    7.  a moment where the facilitator will ask State Councillors to
        disclose any material personal interest they have in relation to
        any scheduled agenda item. State Councillors must disclose any
        material personal interest in relation to any matter being
        considered at this point or as soon as they become aware of
        their interest in the matter. Any disclosure must:

        1.  give details of the nature and extent of the interest;

        2.  give details of the relation of the interest to the matter
            being considered; and

        3.  be recorded in the minutes, with brief details.

Any State Councillor who has a material person interest must not be
present, block consensus or vote while the relevant matter is being
considered, and must disclose the nature and extent of their interest
in the matter at the next State Conference.

## Quorum

41.4 A quorum for a State Council meeting will be the next integer
greater than one third the number of voting members of the State Council
for the time being.

1.  The facilitator will determine whether State Council is quorate at
    the beginning of every meeting. No decision of State Council is
    valid unless the facilitator has declared that the meeting is
    quorate.

2.  State Council is deemed to be quorate until the meeting is closed by
    the facilitator, except if any State Councillor draws the attention
    of the facilitator to a possible lack of quorum at any time during a
    meeting, whereupon the facilitator will count State Councillors
    present to determine whether or not the meeting is still quorate.

## Discussion

1.  The facilitator will allow discussion at any point in the agenda
    where the words “For report only” or “For Formal Decision or
    Approval” do not appear. State Councillors should refrain from
    seeking recognition to speak during times that the facilitator has
    not opened discussion unless there is good reason to do so.

2.  A State Councillor wishing to speak must indicate and be recognised
    by the facilitator before speaking.

3.  If two or more State Councillors seek recognition to speak, the
    facilitator will keep a list and allow any State Councillor making a
    proposal to speak first and take any questions from the floor, and
    thereafter recognise State Councillors in the order in which
    recognition was sought. The facilitator will be flexible with the
    order of recognition of speakers (for example, in the interests of
    affirmative action or to ensure the maximum participation of all
    involved or to allow for discussion of different views).

4.  The facilitator may choose to allow observers to address the
    meeting. If so, the above will apply.

5.  The facilitator will have the right to speak at any time. Minimal
    discussion on substantive matters will be entered into by the
    meeting facilitator.

6.  The facilitator will close discussion when the time allotted for the
    agenda item has expired. An extension of time will only be permitted
    if a procedural question is agreed to (see Standing Orders:
    Procedural Questions).

## Order

1.  State Councillors will at all times during meetings adhere to the
    Code of Conduct and also:

    1.  respect the authority of the facilitator to facilitate debates
        and maintain order; and

    2.  adhere to requests from the facilitator for silence at any
        point.

2.  A point of order may be raised with the facilitator by any State
    Councillor at any time if the State Councillor believes the standing
    orders are being breached. After the point of order has been raised
    with the facilitator, debate on all other matters will be suspended
    until the facilitator has addressed the matter.

3.  If the facilitator deems the frequency or substance of points of
    order from any one State Councillor to be deliberately vexatious,
    that State Councillor must abide by any request of the facilitator
    to cease raising points of order for a period of time stated by the
    facilitator.

## Decision-making Process

1.  Every proposed decision of State Council will:

    1.  begin with the word “that”;

    2.  be recorded in the minutes; and

    3.  have the outcome recorded in the minutes in the terms “agreed
        to” or “not agreed to”.

2.  For the purposes of the Standing Orders, all proposed decisions
    before State Council will be classified in one of two ways:

    1.  proposals relating to substantive matters (see below); or as

    2.  procedural questions relating to procedure (see below).

## Proposals

1.  Proposals are important questions of substance (not procedure) to
    which the principles of consensus decision-making will be fully
    applied.

2.  Proposals will only be considered if:

    1.  they appear in the agenda; or

    2.  a procedural question to allow consideration is agreed to
        (Standing Orders: Procedural Questions); or

    3.  a workshop held earlier during the meeting has constructed a
        Proposal that is directly relevant to the agenda item.

3.  Proposals will be written.

4.  Proposals will be numbered, with numbering beginning at 1 at the
    beginning of each new agenda item.

5.  Proposals will be minuted consistently as follows:

    1.  If a Proposal is dealt with in the usual way:

        1.  *PROPOSAL [number]: that [text of proposal in full].*

        2.  *PROPOSAL [number] [not] agreed to.*

    2.  If a Proposal lapses:

        1.  *PROPOSAL [number]: that [text of proposal in full].*

        2.  *A procedural question, “that the proposal lapse”, was
            agreed to.*

        3.  *PROPOSAL [number] lapsed.*

    3.  If a Proposal is deferred:

        1.  *PROPOSAL [number]: that [text of proposal in full].*

        2.  *A procedural question, “that the Proposal be considered at
            [a later time this day / the next meeting]”, was agreed
            to.*

        3.  *PROPOSAL [number] deferred.*

    4.  If a Proposal is put to a vote as required by a procedural
        question being agreed to:

        1.  *PROPOSAL [number]: that [text of proposal in full].*

        2.  *PROPOSAL [number] not agreed to.*

        3.  *A procedural question “that the proposal be put to a vote”
            was agreed to.*

        4.  *PROPOSAL [number] was put to a vote and was [not]
            agreed to ([number] Ayes; [number] Noes; [number]
            Abstentions).*

48.3 A substantive motion carried by vote, unless provided for elsewhere
in the Constitution, requires at least a 75 per cent majority of votes
cast. Abstentions may be recorded but will not count as a vote, either
for or against

**Amendments to Proposals**

1.  Amendments to Proposals will, if longer than ten words, be written.

2.  Amendments will be determined by consensus or, if required, by straw
    poll (50% +1 required to carry).

3.  If an amendment is accepted, the original Proposal as amended,
    becomes the substantive Proposal, otherwise the original Proposal
    stands.

4.  Further amendments, if any, will be dealt with sequentially as
    above, provided that:

    1.  amendments to amendments (other than grammatical improvements)
        will not be permitted; and

    2.  concurrent consideration of two or more amendments will not be
        permitted.

5.  When all amendments raised have been determined, the substantive
    Proposal (as amended or not) is put for determination by the meeting
    according to normal decision making procedures.

## Procedural questions

1.  Procedural questions are administrative in nature and must be dealt
    with immediately once raised.

2.  Procedural questions may be raised by any State Councillor at any
    time. If the facilitator deems the frequency or substance of
    procedural questions from any one State Councillor to be
    deliberately vexatious, that State Councillor must abide by any
    request of the facilitator to cease raising procedural questions for
    a period of time stated by the facilitator.

3.  Once a procedural question is raised by a State Councillor, that
    State Councillor may briefly state a reason for raising it and the
    facilitator must then immediately ask State Councillors if there is
    any dissent to the procedural question being agreed to. Following
    this:

    1.  if there is no dissent, the procedural question is agreed to; or

    2.  if there is dissent, the facilitator may allow the reasons for
        dissent to be stated briefly, then must ask for a show of hands
        of State Councillors. A simple majority is required for the
        procedural question to be agreed to, with the exception of the
        procedural questions to put a proposal to a vote or to suspend
        Standing Orders, which require a 75% super majority for the
        procedural question to be agreed to.

4.  Procedural questions will only take the form of one of the following
    phrases or of those referred to elsewhere in these Standing Orders:

    1.  “that time for discussion on the Proposal now expire”

        1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to
            require the facilitator to immediately test for consensus on
            the Proposal, that is, to end any discussion immediately.

        2.  It should not be used in an attempt to silence dissent, and
            generally should only be used if the time allotted to debate
            is nearing its end.

    2.  “that the Proposal be considered at a later time this day”

        1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to
            require the State Secretary to schedule time later in the
            day for further consideration of the Proposal at hand.

    3.  “that the Proposal be considered at the next meeting”

        1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to
            require the State Secretary to include the Proposal, in its
            exact form, on the agenda for the next State Council
            meeting.

    4.  “that the matter be considered at the next meeting”

        1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to
            require the State Secretary to schedule time on the agenda
            for the next State Council meeting for debate on the
            substantive matter at hand, but allows flexibility for the
            redrafting of any Proposals.

    5.  “that the Proposal lapse”

        1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to
            defeat, rather than defer, a Proposal, without first testing
            for consensus. It should only be put if it has become
            apparent that a decision on the matter is not required.

    6.  “that Proposal [number] be now considered”

        1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to
            consider a Proposal in a different order to that stated on
            the agenda.

    7.  “that the Proposal be put to a vote”

        1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to
            put the Proposal at hand to a vote.

        2.  It should only be put for the reasons stated in the State
            Constitution; that is, that “if, after a reasonable period
            of time, disagreement persists and a decision cannot be
            deferred, the question will be resolved by vote.”

48.2: Except where this Constitution requires a decision to be made by
consensus only, if, after a reasonable period of time, disagreement
persists and a decision should not be deferred, the question of moving
to a vote on a substantive motion will be resolved by vote. The
procedural question to this effect will be deemed to have been carried
if it is supported by at least a 75 per cent majority.

1.  “that the names and votes of State Councillors voting be recorded”

    1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is for the
        names of those State Councillors voting for, against, or
        abstaining from the previous Proposal, to be recorded in the
        minutes.

    2.  The procedural question must be put within five minutes of the
        facilitator declaring the outcome of the Proposal in question.

    3.  In the event that the list of names by vote type contradicts the
        total recorded in the minutes, the totals will be amended to
        reflect the list.

2.  “that a Proposal regarding [very short description of substance of
    proposal] be considered”

    1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is for State
        Council to consider a Proposal that did not appear on the
        agenda.

3.  “that consideration of this agenda item be extended for [number]
    minutes”

    1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to extend
        time for discussion beyond the time allowed for in the agenda.

4.  “that the words ‘For report only’ be removed from the agenda”

    1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to open
        discussion at a time when the agenda does not allow for open
        discussion (see Standing Orders: Discussion).

    2.  In all but the most important of cases, State Councillors should
        only seek to have the words “For report only” removed from parts
        of the agenda at the beginning of the meeting.

5.  “that the ruling of the facilitator be overturned”

    1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to
        overturn the facilitator’s most recent ruling on a procedural
        matter.

    2.  It must only be raised in the most serious of cases.

6.  “that the facilitator step down”

    1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to
        require the facilitator to step down, and for the State Convenor
        to choose another facilitator.

    2.  It must only be raised in the most serious of cases.

7.  “that [Name] cease raising procedural questions”

    1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to
        disallow any one State Councillor from raising procedural
        questions for the rest of the meeting.

    2.  It must only be raised in the most serious of cases.

8.  “that the standing orders be suspended for [number] minutes to
    allow for [details of matter]”

    1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to
        suspend the standing orders for a determined amount of time.

9.  “that the meeting go in camera to discuss [details of matter]”
    and, if necessary, “and that [observers’ names] be permitted to
    stay due to [short rationale]”

    1.  The effect of this procedural question being agreed is for the
        meeting to go in camera and, if necessary, for certain observers
        to be permitted to stay.

    2.  This procedural question should only be raised when absolutely
        necessary.



1.  Procedural questions will be minuted consistently as follows:

A procedural question, “that [text of question]”, was [not] agreed
to.

1.  Unlike for the recording of the outcomes of Proposals, if procedural
    questions are put to a vote by show of hands, votes, including
    abstentions, are not recorded in the minutes.

## Items for Discussion 

1.  As far as reasonably practicable items listed for Discussion should
    fall into two categories:

    1.  Items listed for short discussion, which generally should be:

        1.  very limited in number;

        2.  limited to 10 minutes duration; and

        3.  either uncontroversial (e.g. a motion of thanks, which it
            would be inappropriate to put through without consideration)
            or necessary (e.g. because the information on which a
            recommendation could be based could only be available at the
            last minute, such as legal advice or a cost-quote, but where
            the matter was otherwise uncontroversial).

    2.  Items listed for full discussion, which should generally:

        1.  be no more than 3 or 4 in number;

        2.  be given a minimum of one hour each on the Agenda, or a
            workshop plus at least half an hour; and

        3.  as far as practicable, contain a brief summary of:

            1.  the history of the matter;

            2.  the contending views. (Only in unusual circumstances
                should a matter be listed for major discussion where
                there were no serious and contending views. As far as
                practicable, where there are contending views, any
                proposals which those holding those contending views
                would like to see adopted, should be circulated); and

            3.  links to relevant articles etc.

2.  Proposals with budgetary implications must indicate where changes to
    income and/or expenditure would need to be made in order to balance
    the current budget.

3.  It is the particular responsibility of State Councillors
    representing Branches to report before the meeting on what the
    issues are which are listed for major discussion, and on the
    outcomes of these discussions.

## Decisions and Recommendations of Standing Committees

1.  For a Decision or Recommendation to be on notice, it must have been
    drawn to the attention of State Councillors by way of a Notice Paper
    that lists all of the Decisions and Recommendations made by the
    Standing Committees since the last State Council meeting 7 clear
    days prior to State Council.

2.  Where a decision or recommendation of a Standing Committee has been
    omitted or abridged in part or whole, for reasons of
    confidentiality, any State Councillor may request that the full
    decision or recommendation be made available to them.

## Decisions of Standing Committees 

1.  All Decisions made by Standing Committees which are “on notice”
    shall not unless listed be the subject of any consideration by State
    Council unless formal objection is received from either:

    1.  Three members of State Council (extending beyond the membership
        of one Branch) given in writing to the State Secretary and to
        the Convenor of the relevant Standing Committee at least 2 clear
        days prior to the meeting (e.g. Wednesday for a Saturday
        meeting), or

    2.  Ten members of state council given in writing to the State
        Secretary and to the Convenor of the relevant Standing
        Committee, if present, (and in any case the facilitator of the
        meeting) within 30 minutes of the commencement of the meeting;

and stating the Decision to which objection is taken and briefly
stating the grounds of objection.

1.  State Councillors must not object pro forma.

2.  The giving of this notice shall permit a procedural proposal to be
    put as follows by “That State Council considers proposals for the
    disallowance or amendment of the [identified] Decision of the
    [named] Standing Committee”.

3.  After allowing not less than one speaker in favour of the procedural
    proposal, it shall be put to a vote, and if carried, the Agenda of
    that meeting will be altered accordingly.

4.  Any Decisions of any Standing Committee which have been made but are
    not “on notice” must (unless confidential – see above) either be
    read out to the State Council meeting or distributed early in the
    meeting in written form. In these circumstances the procedural
    resolution described above may be moved by any State Councillor
    during the meeting. (Note- this is a reason why as a general
    proposition Standing Committee meetings should be held at least 10
    days before State Council.)

## Recommendations of Standing Committees 

1.  All the recommendations of standing committees which are on notice
    and which are listed “For Formal Approval” shall be put to State
    Council as a single proposal in the following form, for which
    consensus shall be tested: “That all recommendations on notice of
    Standing Committees not listed for discussion, and listed only for
    formal approval, be approved.” If formal objection is received from
    3 State Councillors (not all being from one Branch) in writing to
    the Secretary (with a copy to the Convenor of the relevant Standing
    Committee) at least 2 clear days prior to State Council, the
    relevant recommendations shall be included as normal agenda items.

2.  If consensus is not reached on the proposal described above (“That
    all recommendations on notice of Standing Committees not listed for
    discussion, and listed only for formal approval, be approved”)
    discussion will be adjourned forthwith, after the facilitator has
    determined which State Councillors object to which
    recommendation(s), and the testing for consensus on the remaining
    Recommendations to which no objection is taken. It shall then be the
    responsibility of the State Secretary or Assistant State Secretary,
    the State Councillors and the Convenors (or if absent other members)
    of the relevant Standing Committee to discuss in respect of each
    objection:

    1.  Whether there is an amendment which does not alter the character
        of the proposal but which can meet the objection, and that
        consensus be sought on that revised version of the
        recommendation; or

    2.  Whether it should be referred back to the Standing Committee for
        further consideration;

    3.  Whether the item needs to be listed for discussion, and if so at
        the present meeting or at a later meeting.

It is the responsibility of the State Secretary or Assistant Secretary
(as the case may be) to bring back to the meeting a procedural
proposal for a course of action in respect of each Recommendation,
consistent with the above.

1.  Recommendations which do not meet the definition of on notice (7
    clear days) must either be listed for discussion, or deferred to the
    next meeting.

2.  Recommendations from the State Executive are to be treated in the
    same manner as recommendations from a Standing Committee. This is by
    way of distinction from Decisions of the Executive, which require
    ratification.
