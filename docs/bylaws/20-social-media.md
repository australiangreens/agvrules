        the relevant Group.

> shall be removed.

## Guidelines for Private Groups

1.  Any constituent group may create its own private group through AGV
    decision-making procedures.

2.  The constituent group is responsible for informing the Membership
    Engagement Committee of the formation, purpose and termination of
    the private group, and the Membership Engagement Committee is
    responsible for maintaining a list/register of the private groups
    and making it available on the internal AGV website.

3.  Private groups must have clear guidelines on who is eligible to be a
    member of the group. Group administrators will provide access to
    those who meet the criteria and remove those who cease to meet the
    criteria.

4.  Group administrators must include:

    1.  at least one office bearer or delegate for the appropriate
        constituent group; and

    2.  if the constituent group or State Council agrees, the most
        senior staff member.

5.  The constituent group responsible for the private group may appoint
    other AGV members as group administrators, so long as the persons
    appointed have read and understood the Code of Conduct.

6.  The Code of Conduct applies to all conversations within private
    groups.

7.  Group administrators may:

    1.  delete posts that arguably could breach the AGV Constitution and
        Bylaws; and

    2.  permanently remove or temporarily suspend from the group anyone
        whose actions appear to seriously or repeatedly breach the AGV
        Constitution or Bylaws or who disseminates materials from inside
        the group to outside the group, in consultation with the office
        bearers of the relevant constituent group.

8.  A clear statement of rules for participation in the private group,
    including reference to the Code of Conduct, must be made prominently
    known to members. The rules will include notification that group
    members who seriously or repeatedly breach the AGV policies,
    Constitution or Bylaws can be permanently removed or temporarily
    suspended from membership of the group.

9.  Where the criteria for membership of the private group includes
    non-members of the AGV, discussion of internal party matters is not
    permitted in that group. AGV staff are considered to be members of
    the AGV for this purpose.

## Empowered and Authorised

1.  An Administrator may use this access to:

    1.  immediately hide or remove any content:

        1.  that is arguably a clear and serious breach of the Party’s
            Constitution or Bylaws; or

        2.  if directed to do so by the State Executive or Victorian
            Campaign Committee;

    2.  immediately suspend or remove a person’s administrative access
        if:

        1.  content from that person is arguably a clear and serious
            breach of the Party’s constitution or bylaws; and

        2.  directed to do so by the State Executive or Victorian
            Campaign Committee;

    3.  permanently close down a Group or Candidate online asset or
        private group if directed to do so by State Council.

2.  The most senior staff member may not use this access to post content
    to Group or Candidate’s online assets, unless authorised by the
    Group or Candidate.

3.  The most senior staff member may appoint or instruct other employees
    to assist in the implementation of these responsibilities, but
    retains overall responsibility for any actions carried out under
    this section.

## Concerns or Complaints

    private groups may be directed to:
