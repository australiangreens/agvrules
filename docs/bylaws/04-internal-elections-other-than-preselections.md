# Internal Elections Other Than Preselections

1.  Elections (other than preselections) conducted by Branches and
Regional Councils will adhere to the AGV Constitution (e.g.
section 25 codifies the election of Branch office bearers).

2.  The remainder of this bylaw codifies any elections (other than
preselections) conducted by State Council, and the annual election
process for State Office Bearers, the Victorian Campaign Committee
Convenor, the Policy Convenor, and ‘additional Branch
Representatives’ to State Council.

## The State Returning Officer

1.  Each Annual State Conference will include the election of the State
Returning Officer by members of State Council, the position may be
shared by up to 2 people.

2.  The State Returning Officer’s term begins at the end of the Annual
State Conference at which they were elected, and ends at the end
of the next year’s Annual State Conference. Any casual vacancy of
the State Returning Officer position will be filled by the State
Council or State Executive at the first opportunity.

3.  The State Returning Officer shall be responsible for conducting, or
    ensuring the proper conduct in accordance with the rules of, the
    following elections:

    1.  Elections of the State Office Bearers (section 16 of the
    Constitution), Victorian Campaign Committee Convenor (clause
    54.1 of the Constitution) and Policy Convenor (clause 60.1 of
    the Constitution);

    2.  Elections of the additional Branch Representatives to State
    Council as described in clause 40.2 (b) of the Constitution;

    3.  Elections to positions which are to be determined by the State
    Conference and State Council;

    4.  Preselections which default to the State Returning Officer as
    described in the Preselections Bylaw;

    5.  Other elections as may be required by the Constitution.

    6.  Any election where appointed to do so by the State Council or
    State Executive.


4.  The State Returning Officer may agree to conduct other elections at
the request of State Conference or a constituent group.

5.  The State Returning Officer shall not be eligible to:

    1.  Stand for election in any election which they will conduct.
    (Note: where there are two Returning Officers, one may stand
    for election in an election conducted by the other. Where
    there is only one Returning Officer, and they stand for
    election, or where both Returning Officers stand for election
    in a single election, a deputy returning officer approved by
    the State Secretary or State Convenor must be appointed
    pursuant to [clause 8](#clause-8) below to conduct that election.)

    2.  Nominate any person for any election they conduct;

    3.  Sit on the Probity Panel associated with any election they
    conduct.

6.  The State Returning Officer will be the primary contact between
nominees, candidates, and other Greens members making enquiries,
with respect to the conduct of any election they conduct.

7.  The State Returning Officer may appoint up to 3 people at any time
to act as deputy returning officers to assist in the duties of the
State Returning Officer. Final authority and responsibility
remains with the State Returning Officer, except in the
circumstances described in 7 (a) above, in which case the deputy
returning officer will have final authority for that election.

    
8. The State Returning Officer will ensure that where the
implementation of any election requires the use of AGV office
resources, measures are taken to ensure that the appropriate
member of AGV staff is consulted, and that preselection materials
(such as reply paid envelopes) are distinguished from those of any
other election that may be occurring at the same time. 

9.  At the conclusion of the annual elections, the Returning Officer(s)
shall provide an aggregated anonymized report to State Council on
the diversity of nominees and elected candidates to the extent
known.

## Ballots

1.  Except where otherwise determined by the Constitution and bylaws, or
a decision of the State Council or Executive, elections described
in clause 5 will be conducted by secret ballot using paper or
electronic voting.

the State Returning Officer, with the names checked at the
distribution of ballots and, for postal and electronic ballots,
also at the return of ballots.

3.  The roll of eligible voters closes on the close of nominations.

4.  The method of all elections conducted by the State Returning Officer
shall be by Optional Preferential Voting, except where there are
two or more positions to be filled by the one ballot, in which
case a Single Transferrable Vote method shall be used.

member has not provided the information in the previous clause by
the close of nominations. Otherwise, the State Returning Officer

members’ names, phone numbers and email addresses, and may
instigate contact with each eligible voter for the purposes of
discussing or promoting their nomination. The nominee must not

they must nevertheless not discuss their nomination for the
election in question at that Branch meeting.

9.  Party bodies, State Office Bearers, persons employed by the AGV, and
    elected representatives, must not:

    1.  by any means, directly or indirectly, make a statement
    canvassing for or against votes for any nominee; or

    2.  provide any resources to aid any nominee

    account by eligible voters;

and enable all nominees in attendance to, subject to the facilitator’s
and Returning Officer’s discretion, respond to any questions raised or
statements made by members.
