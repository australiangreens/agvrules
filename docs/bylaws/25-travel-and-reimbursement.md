# Travel and Reimbursement


## General Expenditure and Reimbursement.

1.  Members and supporters are entitled to be fully reimbursed for any
    authorised expenditure made in the course of their duties for the
    Party where:

    1.  such expenditure has been budgeted for

    2.  such expenditure has been authorised.

2.  Expenditure can only be authorised by:

    1.  Bodies properly constituted by or under the Constitution of the
        Australian Greens – Victoria “with an agreed budget of their
        own.

    2.  The Most Senior Staff Member.

    3.  The state-wide Campaign Manager (where appointed) for campaign
        related expenditure.

3.  Expenditure to be reimbursed must appear in the budget for the
    authorising body.

4.  All expenditure to be reimbursed must be minuted in the minutes of
    the authorising body except where such expenditure is authorised by
    the Most Senior Staff Member in line with their delegated limits.

5.  Minutes used to support or authorise expenditure should include:

    1.  the decision to authorise the expenditure

    2.  the decision to make the reimbursement, when it occurs,

    3.  attached copies of supporting documentation and

    4.  such other information as the AGV’s Most Senior Staff Member may
        reasonably require.

6.  Reimbursement of expenditure can only occur where the relevant
    supporting documentation is provided.

7.  Relevant supporting documentation includes, but is not limited to:
    invoices, receipts, tickets, vehicle logs, signed and witnessed
    Statutory Declarations.

8.  Liability for reimbursement will not extend beyond the body that
    authorised the expenditure except at the discretion of the AGV

    the supporting documentation being presented to the relevant Party
    body where all the conditions above have been met. Any claim for
    reimbursement must be made within three months from the date of the
    expenditure.

10. Where expenditure is election-related, special rules, as established
    by the AGV’s Most Senior Staff Member, may apply. These rules may
    define or restrict what expenditure can be claimed, what documents
    are required to support such a claim and what processes are
    appropriate to authorise the expenditure (for example, purchase
    orders needing to be raised).

11. A member may only claim reimbursement up to the amount of actual
    expenses incurred as evidenced by the documentation.

## Claimable Expenses

1.  An authorised event, for the purposes of reimbursement of expenses,
    will include any event an AGV member is required to attend as a
    nominated attendee, delegate, committee member or representative of
    the AGV. For the avoidance of doubt the following will automatically
    be authorised events:

    1.  meetings of the State Executive

    2.  meetings of the Standing Committees of State Council

    3.  meetings of the Constitution Review Panel

    4.  meetings of the Audit and Finance Committee

    8.  meetings of the Mediation, Misconduct or Administrative Review
        Panels.

2.  Where a member attends any one of these events as an observer,
    rather than a nominated attendee, delegate or representative of the
    AGV, there is no entitlement for reimbursement of expenses.

3.  Where the authorising and reimbursing body is the AGV, other events
    may be classified as authorised events at the discretion of the Most
    Senior Staff Member of the AGV.

4.  Members are not entitled to claim accommodation expenses for
    meetings that take place within the State of Victoria unless the
    member must travel more than 100kms from their usual home address to
    attend an authorised event.

5.  The reimbursement available for eligible persons for authorised
    events within the State of Victoria will be limited to the amount
    specified in the Reimbursement Schedule per person except where a
    higher amount of authorised expenditure has been provided for in the
    budget of the relevant party body.

6.  For an authorised event:

    1.  Only those required to be in attendance will qualify for
        reimbursement. I.E. State Council members, State Office Bearers,
        the Representatives of Members Elected to Public Office,
        committee members, persons attending at the request of the AGV
        and persons attending to present to the meeting in question.

    2.  Only the cost of travel to and from the venue of the meeting
        will be eligible for reimbursement and this may include;
        airfares, public transport, taxis or the use of a private
        vehicle (which will be reimbursed based the maximum standard
        rate per kilometre as defined by the ATO).

    3.  For those eligible to have their transport costs reimbursed and
        where a ticket/receipt for transport cannot be produced,
        reimbursement will be made in line with current transport rates.

    4.  The AGV encourages the use of billeting where it is available
        however members who, for whatever reason, are required to attend
        events on behalf of the AGV and choose to make use of hotels or
        other similar facilities, are entitled to reimbursement up to
        the amount specified in the Reimbursement Schedule. Only the
        night before the meeting or the night following the meeting will
        be claimable unless determined otherwise by the Most Senior
        Staff Member of the AGV.

    5.  Members are entitled to claim childcare expenses for the period
        of the event (including the night either before or after in line
        with 17(d)) and the time taken to travel to and from the event.
        The rate of reimbursement for childcare is specified in the
        Reimbursement Schedule.

7.  Where members agree to allow the AGV State Office to organise the
    travel and accommodation to an interstate or international
    authorised event, the following expenses will be eligible for

8.  With regard to clause 18, the AGV undertakes to consult with any
    person travelling on behalf of the AGV to an authorised event about

    understanding that the AGV’s Most Senior Staff Member will make the
    final decision on what is acceptable.
