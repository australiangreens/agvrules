# General Operations of Standing Committees

1.  This by-law elaborates the functions, powers and composition of the
    Victorian Campaign Committee (which shall be known as the Campaign
    Committee) and the Policy Steering Committee (which shall be known
    as the Policy Committee), the National Conference Committee, the
    Finance, Administration and Infrastructure Committee and the
    Membership Engagement Committee.

## Delegation of Powers in specific matter

1.  In addition to any specific power granted to any Standing Committee
    by the Constitution and this by-law, State Council or State
    Executive can, subject to such conditions as it thinks fit, delegate
    the making of any decision on a specifically defined matter within
    its power, to any Standing Committee or to two or more committees in
    which case the decision will require the agreement of each committee
    concerned. Such a decision is not considered merely procedural (i.e.
    it cannot be done merely be simple majority).

2.  State Council or State Executive, and specifically the facilitator
    at the time such delegation is made, must ensure that the delegation
    is clearly defined and that the limits of the delegation are clear.

3.  The terms of reference of each Standing Committee are deemed to
    include the delegation described in this section, but to avoid
    doubt, no delegation can be taken as including any power to change
    any By-law, and any such specific delegation (i.e. not included in
    the terms of reference) only operates for a specific period which
    must be defined in the delegation. Such a delegation may be made
    subject to such direction or condition as is specified.

## State Executive not to direct Committees but may stay decisions

1.  State Executive cannot direct any Standing Committee to make any
    particular decision and cannot direct its work (AGV Constitution
    Clause 46.8). However, State Executive may request a Standing
    Committee to review a decision, and may determine to put a stay on
    any decision of any Standing Committee, or part of a decision,
    pending the next State Council, or for such shorter time as it
    determines.

2.  In addition, wherever it appears to an Office Bearer or to the
    Convenor of a Standing Committee that two or more Standing
    Committees have made inconsistent decisions, or that a Standing
    Committee has acted outside its power the Executive may resolve the
    matter by making its own decision (except where this would involve
    the Executive making Policy), or otherwise acting beyond its powers
    (AGV Constitution Clause 46.5).

## When a Standing Committee is to make a decision and when it is to make a recommendation

1.  It is the intention of State Council that wherever the State Council
    has delegated to a Standing Committee under this by-law or
    otherwise, the power to make a decision (as opposed to State Council
    merely delegating a power to make a recommendation), then in the
    normal course of events it is expected that the Standing Committee
    will make decisions about these matters and will not merely make
    recommendations.

2.  Therefore, there should be unusual circumstances why a Standing
    Committee only makes a recommendation where it could make a
    decision. Such circumstances might include the importance of the
    matter in the particular context, or the level of controversy about
    the matter in the Party.

3.  It is the intention of State Council that wherever the State Council
    has delegated to a Standing Committee under its terms of reference,
    the power to make a recommendation, then in the normal course of
    events it is expected that the Standing Committee will make
    recommendations which do not require a further decision of the State
    Council, other than mere approval of the recommendation

4.  If Standing Committee is of the view that an issue should be an item
    for discussion at State Council, this does not of itself mean it
    should fail to make a substantive recommendation, but the Committee
    may request the Secretary that the item be listed for discussion.

## Quorum and QDMG

1.  The provisions regarding quorum, QDMG and election of general
    members do not apply to the National Conference Committee.

2.  The quorum for a meeting of a Standing Committee shall be at least
    half of its members. However quorum for the Finance Administration
    Infrastructure and Staffing Committee must also include any of the
    State Secretary or in their absence, the Assistant State Secretary,
    or the State Treasurer.

3.  Each Standing Committee shall appoint a Quick Decision Making Group,
    which must have four members and must include at least one of the
    office bearers (or if no office bearer is a member of the Committee,
    at least one member of the State Executive). A decision by a QDMG
    must be supported by at least 3 members and must not be opposed by
    any member of the QDMG, and must be ratified in the minutes and
    Record of Decisions at the next meeting.

## Election of General members of Standing Committees

1.  General members of Standing Committees shall be elected by a postal
    or electronic ballot of all members prior to State Conference.

2.  Any casual vacancy of a standing committee shall be filled by State
    council at the next meeting which allows for sufficient notice of
    the vacancy to be given to members, and the state Returning Officers
    may establish procedures to enable nominations to be lodged prior to
    that State Council meeting, and for voting to continue after that
    State Council meeting. State Council may delegate the filling of
    such vacancy to the Executive if insufficient nominations are
    received.

## Removal of General members of Standing Committees

1.  A member of a Standing Committee (other than a person who holds that
    position by virtue of holding another office, but including any
    Policy Sub-Committee) may resign in writing to the Convenor of the
    Standing Committee or to the State Secretary.

2.  Wherever a member of a Standing Committee (other than a person who
    holds that position by virtue of holding another office):

    1.  fails to attend two consecutive meetings without apology; or

    2.  fails to attend three meetings with apologies (excluding
        exceptional circumstances where leave of absence is granted from
        the Committee for not more than three months); or

    3.  is found to have committed misconduct; or

    4.  appears to be unable or unwilling to contribute to the work of
        the Committee;

    The Convenor of the Committee will contact that member to discuss
    their continued membership of the Committee. Should the member not
    resign and should the Convenor after that discussion not be satisfied
    about the continued involvement of that member, the Convenor of the
    Committee will, as they consider appropriate, recommend to the State
    Executive in writing (with a copy to the member) that the member’s
    position be declared vacant, and the State Executive may upon this
    recommendation remove the member from the Standing Committee, provided
    the member has been afforded an opportunity to be heard. This is
    subject to review by State Council should the member challenge the
    decision.

1.  Under no other circumstances and for no other reason shall the State
    Executive have the power to remove a member of a Standing Committee,
    but State Council may do so at its discretion provided an
    opportunity has been afforded to the Standing Committee member to be
    heard prior to any such decision being made.

## Office Bearers

1.  A Standing Committee Convenor will be responsible for:

    1.  facilitating meetings of the Committee, or delegating this
        responsibility to another member for any meeting;

    2.  in conjunction with the Secretary, ensuring that the appropriate
        notice of meeting, agenda and motions on notice are provided in
        good time;

    3.  ensuring that the business of each Committee meeting is properly
        addressed;

    4.  presenting Committee reports to the State Council;

    5.  acting as the Committee’s primary point of contact with State
        Office Bearers and State Councillors, except where decided
        otherwise by the Committee;

    6.  in consultation with the State Secretary, corresponding with the
        National Office Bearers on behalf of the Committee.

2.  All Standing Committees shall be required to appoint a Secretary at
    their first meeting after each AGV Annual State Conference or as
    vacancies arise.

3.  A Standing Committee Secretary shall be charged with:

    1.  in conjunction with the Convenor, ensuring that the appropriate
        notice of meeting, agenda and motions on notice are provided in
        good time;

    2.  in combination with the Convenor, the creation of meeting
        agendas;

    3.  the taking of meeting minutes;

    4.  the uploading of these minutes to the internal AGV website
        within one week of each meeting;

    5.  liaising with the Returning Officers to ensure that any
        Committee vacancies are addressed; and

    6.  maintaining any e-lists of the Committee.

## Meetings

1.  Standing Committees are required to establish and publish on the
    internal AGV website a meeting schedule early in their terms. Any
    changes to the schedule are to be advised to State Council.

2.  A Standing Committee will meet as needed, but not less than four
    times a year, to carry out its duties.

3.  Wherever possible, at least one week’s notice will be given of all
    meetings of the Standing Committee.

4.  Urgent meetings may be called if required but not with less than 24
    hours’ notice.

5.  A Standing Committee will not make decisions except at meetings or
    by Quick Decision.

6.  Standing Committee attendance records must be kept and displayed on
    the internal AGV website, and reported to each Annual State
    Conference.
