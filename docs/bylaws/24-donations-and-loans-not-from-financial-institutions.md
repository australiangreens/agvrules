# Donations and Loans not from Financial Institutions

1.  The Australian Greens - Victoria (AGV), as a party committed to
    enhancing Australia’s democratic process, will pursue the model of
    publicly funded elections at all levels of government. Publicly
    funded elections would promote more equitable access and reduce the
    risk of corruption associated with donations.

2.  AGV will accept donations, including gifts-in-kind as defined by the
    Australian Electoral Commission, using transparent practices.

3.  Gifts in-kind will be treated as any other donation to the AGV (for
    further details please see the Treasurer’s Handbook).

4.  AGV may reject any donation or refund any donation at any time

5.  AGV will ensure that where any donor’s one-off or cumulative
    donations to AGV totals $1,000 or more within a financial year their
    donations are subject to ethical review.

6.  Any party member may request that the AGV conduct an ethical review
    of any donation.

7.  At times AGV may also seek to finance its expenditure through loans
    that are not provided by financial institutions. These loans will be
    subject to ethical review where either:

    1.  the value of the loan is $10,000 or more; or

    2.  the loan agreement has conditions under which the loan could
        convert into a donation and the value of the loan is $1,000 or
        more.

8.  Ethical review of donations and non-commercial loans will be
    undertaken by AGV State Council (or State Executive or State Quick
    Decision Making Group depending on amount and urgency) and will:

    1.  seek to ensure that the values and aspirations of all donors and
        lenders are not inconsistent with those encapsulated in the
        goals, policies and the Charter of the Australian Greens
        Victoria;

    2.  accept donations and loans only for supporting the aims of the
        Party;

    3.  refuse any donation or loan if any conditions are imposed by the
        donor or lender;

    4.  refuse any donation or loan if it gives rise to or is likely to
        give rise to a conflict of interest as defined below.

9.  The person verifying that the requirements of clause 8 have been
    met:

    1.  will not be associated with the donor in any way as far as
        practicable (i.e. the verifying person should not be a relative
        of the donor, co-habituating with, etc.)

    2.  will not be a candidates for election, nor that person's
        campaign manager with regard to donations to their own or any
        other campaign being conducted at the same time.

    3.  should contact the donor to confirm that the requirements are
        met. Further a full audit trail of the process should be kept
        (i.e. emails/correspondence confirming that the requirements
        have been met).

10. Further, AGV will:

    1.  ensure that any donations solicited or accepted on behalf of the
        AGV by members or supporters of the AGV are used for AGV
        endorsed activities and not for the personal use of the member
        or supporter;

    2.  maintain transparency in donor identity by reporting within 3
        months of the end of each financial year all donors and the
        cumulative total of their donations to AGV over the previous
        financial year where those cumulative totals amount to $1,000 or
        more;

    3.  maintaining transparency in donor identity by including in the
        party's Annual Returns to the Australian Electoral Commission
        details of all donations which cumulatively total more than
        $1,000 for the financial year”; and

    4.  ensure that any donations or loans received that are
        subsequently rejected as a result of this bylaw are returned to
        the donor or lender at the earliest opportunity;

    5.  report all donations to local, state and federal electoral
        authorities as required by laws applicable and current at the
        time of the donation;

    6.  advise potential and/or intending donors of disclosure
        requirements of laws referred to in 8(e) above.

11. The acceptance of any donation by AGV does not imply endorsement of
    the activities, undertakings or processes of the donor.

12. It is the responsibility of the AGV State Treasurer to monitor all
    donations and loans received or offered to AGV and ensure all
    donations and loans which are subject to review, or may be subject
    to rejection under this bylaw are promptly referred for review.

13. To support the application of this bylaw:

    1.  donations may only be directed to the AGV state party, regional
        councils, branches or electoral campaigns. Donations may be
        directed to campaigns for a specific election or electorate.
        Donations may not be directed to individual members (including
        candidates and elected representatives);

    2.  any donation of $1,000 or more, or any donation which there is
        reason to think may bring the total donation for a particular
        donor to $1,000 or more in a financial year, shall be referred
        to the AGV State Treasurer for review prior to the donation
        being accepted;

    3.  the AGV website and other relevant documentation shall provide
        donors with information on statutory disclosure requirements and
        the disclosure principles embodied in this by-law;

    4.  an official AGV receipt will be issued and the name and address
        of the donor recorded for all donations unless the donor
        requests the donation be anonymous. Any donation of $50 or more
        must have an official AGV receipt issued and the name and
        address of the donor recorded. Anonymous donations of $50 or
        more cannot be accepted. This is to facilitate monitoring
        cumulative individual donations against the $1,000 disclosure
        limit;

    5.  Where the donor of a donation in excess of $50 cannot be
        identified within 3 months of the donation, the money will be
        moved to a trust account where it may be held for a period of up
        to 6 months to facilitate a further attempt to identify the
        donor. If after this time the donor cannot be identified the
        money will be forwarded on to a charity of FAIC’s choice. These
        transactions may be authorised by the Senior Most Staff member
        or their delegate;

    6.  any donations accepted on behalf of the AGV shall be deposited
        into an AGV bank account or petty cash fund within 7 days;

    7.  all donations received by branches, regional councils or
        election campaign committees shall be reported to the AGV
        Finance Officer quarterly. This report shall include an itemized
        list of donations including the name and address of each
        non-anonymous donor.

## Definitions

### Donations:

(from www.aec.gov.au “Funding and Disclosure Handbook for Donors and
Third Parties”)

> *A disposition of property or provision of a service for which no
> payment, or an inadequate payment, is received. The term includes cash
> and non-cash (gift-in-kind) transactions, but does not include
> commercial transactions or volunteer labour.*

(NB. This is a summary and the full AEC definition should be consulted.)

### Conflict of Interest:

AGV adopts the OECD definition of conflict of interest which is:

A ‘conflict of interest’ involves a conflict between the public duty and
the private interests of a public official, in which the public official
has private interests which could improperly influence the performance
of their official duties and responsibilities.

Public duty. It is the duty of members of The Greens to uphold the
Greens Charter and promote our policies. It is the public duty of
elected representatives and other officials of The Greens to represent
their constituents impartially and act without undue influence in the
community interest.

Private interests. Candidates, elected representatives and other
officials of The Greens are the beneficiaries of political donations
directly or to the Party and hence have a private interest in those
donations. They could be, or could be reasonably perceived to be,
influenced by donations (and a desire to maintain them) in the conduct
of their public duties. In general larger donations have a greater
potential to give rise to the perception of a conflict of interest.

Conflict. Conflict arises where decisions are actually, potentially or
perceived to be made against the public interest and/or duty as a result
of private interests. In addition a conflict of interest exists if the
donor is likely to receive a material benefit from a reasonably
foreseeable decision that could be made by the Party or an elected
Green, unless such benefit is likely to occur as a result of the donor
being a member of such a broad class of beneficiary that their
individual benefit is not readily identifiable or known or
distinguishable from other members of that class.

A conflict of interest also still exists where a donation is received
from a third party or associated entity related to the individual or
entity where the conflict of interest originates.
