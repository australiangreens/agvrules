# Branch Representatives on State Council 

## Filling a Casual Vacancy for Regional Branch Representatives

## Scope

1\. This section of the by-law is made under clause 40.7 of the
Constitution.

2\. Where a casual vacancy occurs for a Branch Representative State
Councillor elected under clause 40.2 (b) of the Constitution, i.e.
elected from a Legislative Council region, the vacancy will be filled in
accordance with this bylaw.

## Process to Fill the Vacancy

3\. If there is more than one vacancy, vacancies will be filled one at a
time in accordance with the below.

4\. The State Secretary will appoint two disinterested persons to
determine which Branch in the Legislative Council region in question is
the ‘most underrepresented’ by Branch Representatives.

5\. In determining which Branch is ‘most underrepresented’, the two
disinterested persons will be given access to a current database of
members and will apply the following formula:

1.  For each Branch assigned to the Legislative Council region in
    question which has 15 or more members, a figure will be determined
    which is the number of members in that Branch divided by the
    number of currently serving Branch Representatives (both
    Branch-elected and regionally-elected under clauses 40.2 (a)
    and (b) of the Constitution respectively) registered as members of
    that Branch;

2.  The Branch with the highest figure will be determined to be the
    ‘most underrepresented’;

6\. The Branch identified above will be notified by the State Secretary
and may then appoint a Branch Representative to fill the casual vacancy.

## Election of Schedule 1 Branch Representatives

## Scope

7\. This section of the by-law is made under Schedule 1 clauses 4 and
6(c) of the Constitution.

8\. Where there is an election for a Branch Representative State
Councillor for a Schedule 1 Local Government Area, i.e. the City of
Greater Geelong, the Borough of Queenscliffe and the Shire of Yarra
Ranges, the election will be conducted in accordance with this bylaw.

**Process to Elect the Representative**

9\. The members in each Schedule 1 Local Government Area shall, if it
has at least 15 members, elect one Branch Representative to State
Council (including to a casual vacancy) by:

\(a\) a concurrent decision of all the Branches in existence within that
Local Government Area; or

\(b\) failing a decision being reached, a postal or electronic ballot
of all the members in that Local Government Area.

## Participation and Alternate Representation

## Scope

10\. This section of the by-law is made under clause 40.9 of the
Constitution.

## Process

11\. If a Branch Representative elected under clause 40.2(a) of the
Constitution is unable to attend a particular meeting of State Council,
then their Branch may appoint a member (the proxy) to act instead of the
Branch Representative (the proxy giver) at that meeting, provided that
the proxy is and will be eligible to be elected to the proxy-giver’s
position on State Council.

1.  The State Secretary must be notified of the proxy’s appointment by
    the Branch Convenor or Secretary, in writing, at least three days
    before the State Council meeting.

2.  A Branch Representative may be a proxy giver no more than twice
    during the period between two consecutive Annual State Conferences.

14\. No person may exercise more than one vote at State Council
regardless of proxies.
