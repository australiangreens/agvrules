# National Affairs

## National Councillors

1.  State Council will appoint two National Councillors annually.
    National Councillors may have an alternate if they are not present
    at any given National Council meeting. The alternate will be
    appointed by State Council from among the National Conference
    Representatives.

2.  All National Councillors have the task of acting in the best
    interest of the Australian Greens, but must do so with an
    understanding of the informed opinions of their state branch and its
    constituent bodies.

3.  The roles of the national councillors will include:

    1.  To attend monthly National Council meetings.

    2.  To attend, report to and follow directions of the AGV State
        Council.

    3.  To attend, report to and follow directions of the AGV State
        Executive.

    4.  Be familiar with and communicate regularly with AGV State office
        bearers and the AGV Executive.

    5.  To consult and be informed by relevant state standing
        committees, and AGV representatives on Australian Greens Working
        Groups.

    6.  To ask the state convenor to initiate a Quick Decision Making
        Group meeting if a decision is to be made by National Council
        on:

        1.  Expenditure or commitment to expenditure outside of an
            agreed AG budget; or

        2.  Any matter that has legal implications; or

        3.  When the decision is likely to impact disproportionally on
            the interests of the AGV.

    7.  To be responsible for acting as the National Conference
        Committee’s primary point of contact with members of other
        states’ delegations to National Council and Conference, on
        matters pertaining to Victorian positions on proposals before
        National Council and Conference, except where decided otherwise
        by the Committee.

4.  National Councillors must attend at least 8 meetings of the AGV
    executive per year and must provide reports available to members on
    the occasions of meetings of State Executive and State Council.
    Relevant issues arising should be promptly brought to the attention
    of relevant office bearers, standing committee convenors or the most
    senior staff member.

5.  National Councillors must provide verbal reports (default) or
    written reports (if attendance is not possible) to each meeting of
    the AGV State Council on Australian Greens’ current issues and
    decisions, which will be listed for discussion.

## Eligibility to Serve as a National Councillor

1.  The two National Councillors will be appointed as a single ticket.
    That is to say, State Council will appoint one team of two
    Councillors from among those teams who have nominated, as opposed to
    separately electing two councillors.

2.  In order to nominate for the position of National Councillor, both
    members must belong to one or more of the following eligible groups:

    1.  The first seven elected National Conference representatives
        elected at the State Conference

    2.  The current 4 State Office Bearers

    3.  The immediate past State Office Bearers

    At least one member must belong to the group described in 7a.

1.  In nominating for the positions of National Councillors, the team of
    two eligible members must specify which among them will serve as the
    primary representative on the State Executive, and which will act as
    convenor of the National Conference Committee.

2.  In the event that a National Councillor ceases to hold office but
    the other National Councillor does not cease to hold office:

    1.  At the next meeting of the State Council, that meeting shall
        make a determination to confirm a nomination made by the
        remaining National Councillor of any elected National Conference
        representative or member otherwise eligible under clause 7 of
        this by-law to join the National Councillor team, in a vote
        requiring 75% of votes cast to be in favour.

    2.  In the absence of (a) occurring at that meeting, a new election
        shall be held for joint tickets for both National Councillor
        positions, with the eligibility outlined at clause 7(a) of this
        by-law expanded to include all current National Conference
        representatives, and with the remaining National Councillor
        continuing in their role until such time as the results are
        declared

    those positions.

2.  The Victorian Positions Document will be created in accordance with
    the following process.

3.  The Committee will meet to create a draft Victorian Positions
    Document, which will propose a position on all known matters on the
    agenda of the relevant National Conference meeting, and specify
    which member of the Committee will be the primary negotiator for
    each position. The positions on proposals will generally be written
    in such a way so as not to preclude negotiated changes to the
    proposals at the relevant National Conference meeting.

4.  The draft Victorian Positions Document will be distributed to State
    Councillors along with the National Conference proposals themselves
    accompanied with a request that State Councillors consult their
    Branch members, and specify those key items of importance that
    guidance is particularly being sought on.

5.  Any feedback from State Councillors will be distributed to all
    Committee members;

6.  Whenever a State Council meeting falls before the relevant National
    Conference meeting, the presentation of the Draft Victorian
    Positions Document must feature on the agenda of that State Council
    meeting.

7.  The State Council will debate the Draft Victorian Positions Document
    in plenary or workshop, and amendments may be made.

8.  After any amendments have been agreed to, the Victorian Positions
    Document as a whole will be put to the State Council for
    endorsement.

## Accountability

1.  The Victorian Positions Document shall not be binding on any
    representative to National Conference. However, it must form the
    basis of attempting to build consensus at the National Conference,
    unless circumstances arise which were not foreseen at the time of
    its adoption. Any position included in the Victorian Positions
    Document must be explained to the National Conference during the
    first substantive discussion of the relevant matter.

2.  All National Conference Representatives must attend meetings of a
    Victorian Delegates Caucus, convened by the NCC Convenor, as and
    when they are convened, and the decisions of that Caucus will be
    recorded.

3.  Where meetings of the Committee occur during a National Conference
    meeting it is acknowledged that detailed minutes may not be kept.
    However a written report for presentation to the next regular
    meeting of the Committee that clearly states the outcomes of all
    proposals and how these outcomes compared to the positions in the
    Victorian Positions Document will be prepared. This report will form
    the basis for the report to State Council of National Conference
    meetings.

4.  Any representative who blocks, or votes for or against a position
    which is contrary to both of the Victorian Positions Document and a
    decision of the Victorian Delegates Caucus must provide an
    explanation that blocking or vote at the next State Council meeting.

## Victorian National Conference Representatives

    held either before (during the other postal or electronic ballots)
    or at the Annual State Conference.

2.  The AGV will not appoint more National Conference representatives
    than the number specified in the AG Constitution.

3.  The Committee Convenor will be responsible for holding proxy votes
    for National Conference representatives who are not present at any
    given National Conference meeting, and proxy vote in accordance with
    the decisions of the Committee or the Victorian Delegates Caucus.

4.  Should any National Conference representative position/s fall
    vacant, the Committee will appoint an acting National Conference
    representative as relevant to act until the next State Council
    meeting, at which point an election will be held for a replacement.
    The election will be open to all members.

5.  If however the National Conference representative position/s fall
    vacant and there are respectively no National Council or Conference
    meetings scheduled between the time that the vacancy arises and the
    anticipated date of the Annual State Conference, the position will
    remain vacant until the Annual State Conference.

6.  The work of National Conference representatives will be conducted
    through and regulated by the Committee, in accordance with this
    bylaw.
