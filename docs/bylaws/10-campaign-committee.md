# Campaign Committee

## Scope

1.  The Constitution of the AGV provides for the establishment of an
    Electoral and Continuous Campaigning Committee in Section 53. This
    By-law governs the operation of that Committee.

## Functions

2.  The name of the Committee shall be the Campaign Committee, but it
    may also be cited as the Electoral and Continuous Campaigning
    Committee.

3.  The functions of the Campaign Committee include those set out in the
    Constitution, as follows:

    :::note Constitution Extract

    *53.1. Reporting to State Council, the formulation of state-wide AGV
    electoral and continuous campaigning policy and the management of its
    application will be the responsibility of the Electoral and Continuous
    Campaigning Committee created as a Standing Committee of State Council
    under this Chapter.*
    *53.2. The Electoral and Continuous Campaigning Committee is
    responsible for:*
    1.  *developing electoral and continuous campaigning policy with
        state-wide cover for local government and state parliamentary
        elections, and managing such campaigns;*
    2.  *liaising with regional electoral and continuous campaigning
        committees and Branches to facilitate the goals of this Chapter;*
    3.  *collaborating with relevant Party bodies to develop national
        electoral and continuous campaigning policy;*
    4.  *reporting to State Council on all other matters referred to it by
        State Council;*

    :::

4.  Without limiting the operation of clause 3 above,
    the Committee is responsible for the general management of electoral
    and related campaigns within the resources allocated to it by State
    Council or otherwise; and for the implementation of:

    <subclause-letters>

    1.  Applicable decisions of State Council regarding State electoral
        and related campaign matters;

    2.  Applicable decisions of Branches and Regions and of State
        Council in respect of local government elected and related
        campaigns;

    3.  Applicable decisions of State Council and the Australian Greens
        in respect of national electoral and related campaigns;

    </subclause-letters>

    but not so as to give it control over the resources of any other Party
    body.

5.  The Committee must recommend to State Council for adoption, a
    Campaign Strategy Statement, of no more than 500 words, that covers
    a nominated prospective period, and which is to include (but need
    not be limited to):

    <subclause-letters>

    1.  Strategic objectives;

    2.  priority policy issues;

    3.  the general approach to the content and method of campaigning;

    4.  approaches to organisational and communication questions;

    5.  Lessons from past experience; and

    6.  How the strategy will maximise the participation of party
        members.

    </subclause-letters>

6.  Wherever State Council adopts a campaign Strategy Statement, the
    campaign Committee must in performing its functions be guided by
    that Statement, or if it departs from that guidance, must note that
    in its minutes and report this to the next State Council.

7.  Prior to the expiry of the period covered by a campaign strategy
    statement, the Committee must recommend and present to State Council
    a further Strategy Statement.

8.  Except on a pro-tem basis with the approval of the State Executive,
    and subject to such conditions as the State Executive may prescribe
    in any circumstance, the Campaign Committee may only authorise
    expenditure pursuant to a budget approved by State Council, after
    its consideration by the Standing Committee responsible for Finance.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, total expenditure may exceed that
    provided for in the budget provided that (and only provided that);

    <subclause-letters>

    1.  the Standing Committee responsible for Finance, on the
        recommendation of the Treasurer; or the Executive; has approved
        this increase on the basis of a determining that there is
        sufficiently certain basis to increase a corresponding income or
        revenue budget line within the Committee’s budget; or

    2.  the Executive has allocated other funds to cover the increase in
        expenditure.
    
    </subclause-letters>

9.  When a budget has been approved by State Council, the Campaign
    Committee may amend the budget provided that the following
    conditions are met:

    <subclause-letters>

    1.  there is no increase in total expenditure (except as provided
        for in [6](#Bylaw21Clause6) above);

    2.  any proposal to reduce an allocation of the funds to be
        controlled by to any Branch, Regional Council, Branch-based or
        Region-based election campaign committee, as compared to the
        budget approved by State Council or any amended budget approved
        by the Committee, must not occur unless the Convenor or (if the
        Convenor appears to be unavailable) some other appropriate
        person from each of these bodies has been invited to the meeting
        and given the opportunity to be heard; and the reduction has
        then been then approved by the State Executive; and no such
        reduction shall have effect if any such body would be unable to
        meet its commitments solely because of such a reduction.

    3.  Any such amendment is not contrary to any decision of State
        Council (other than the decision to adopt the budget itself)
    
    </subclause-letters>

10.  Wherever it appears to the Convenor of the Campaign Committee or to
    the Treasurer, that in connection with an election, there will be
    significant additional funds available to spend on campaign related
    expenditure in connection with that election then, subject only to
    there being sufficient time available before the relevant election
    having regard to the urgency of making decisions, the Campaign
    Committee shall, prior to allocating such additional funds, the
    Convenor or (if the Convenor appears to be unavailable) some other
    appropriate person from each Branch, Regional Council, Branch-based
    or Region-based election campaign committee having responsibility
    for the conduct of a relevant election, shall been invited to any
    meeting which is to consider that allocation, and shall be given the
    opportunity to be heard.

11. In addition to any other obligations under this bylaw, the Campaign Committee must not less than once every four months, and;

    <subclause-letters>

    1. within ten days of the dissolution of the State or Federal Parliament (or a House thereof);

    2. between 4 and 6 weeks prior to a date on which local government elections are to be generally held across the state;

    </subclause-letters>

    hold a meeting of the Campaign Committee to which all the Convenors or
    (if the Convenor appears to be unavailable) some other appropriate
    person from each Branch, Regional Council, Branch-based or
    Region-based election campaign committee having responsibility for the
    conduct of a relevant election campaign shall been invited to that
    meeting. Such a meeting may be held in conjunction with any special
    meeting of State Council held because of the calling of an election.

12. The Campaign Committee is responsible for determining the
    pre-selection process for Senate pre-selection and for directing the
    implementation of that process. Moreover, the Campaign Committee has
    the responsibility to ensure that other party bodies are carrying
    out pre-selection decisions, and for settling the date by which such
    decisions must be taken. Where it appears that the situation
    requires it, the Campaign Committee may do any act or thing
    necessary, or authorise a person to do any act or thing to ensure
    that there is a candidate for a specific State or Commonwealth
    parliamentary election, in circumstances where:

    <subclause-letters>

    1. A decision has been made that the Party is to have such a candidate;

    2. For any reason no candidate has been selected, or a candidate
        has been selected and for any reason is no longer to be the
        candidate; and

    3. Under the relevant procedures applicable, it is not reasonably
        practicable for the Party to select a candidate, and the
        relevant Branches and campaign committees are consulted.

    </subclause-letters>

13.  The Campaign Committee is responsible within its powers, for
    ensuring that campaign communication infrastructure is effective.

14.  By force of this By-law, and subject to any specific decision made
    from time to time by State Council, State Council delegates its
    powers under Sections 56.1, 56.2, 56.5 and 56.8 (Preselection
    Processes), to the Campaign Committee.

    1.  Three general members elected for a term of up to two years
        which may be expressed as a period of time or as related to an

        40.5 of the AGV State Constitution.

        campaign working groups

    </subclause-letters>

## Campaign Management Team

1.  The Campaign Committee may also meet in the form of the Campaign
    Management Committee, which shall consist of :

    <subclause-letters>

    1.  The Convenor the Campaign Committee (or if the Convenor is
        unable to attend, they may nominate one of the two members of
        the Campaign Committee elected by State Council to attend in
        their place);

    1.  The most senior member of the AGV staff.

    1.  Between 2 and 4 AGV members appointed by the Campaign Committee
        from time to time.

    </subclause-letters>

2.  The quorum for the Campaign Committee shall be at least half of its
    members.

3.  The State Party Convenor, if not otherwise a member, shall be
    entitled to be advised of a meeting of the Campaign Management
    Committee, and shall be entitled to attend or to appoint a member of
    the State Executive to attend in their place. The State Party
    Treasurer shall be entitled to attend and advised of the time of
    meetings. The most senior member of the AGV staff acts as the
    Secretary of the Campaign Management Committee.

4.  The Campaign Management Committee shall have all the powers of the
    Full session Campaign Committee, except the following:

    <subclause-letters>

    1.  Amending the Campaign Committee budget to increase total
        expected expenditure;

    1.  Reducing the allocation in the budget to any Branch, Regional
        Council, Branch-based or Region-based election campaign
        committee having responsibility for the conduct of a relevant
        election;

    1.  Acting in a manner inconsistent with an explicit decision or
        direction of the Campaign Committee;

    1.  Exercising any of the delegated powers of State Council under
        Section 56 of the Constitution.

    </subclause-letters>

22. In performing their functions, each of the Campaign Committee (full session) and the Campaign Management Group shall be mindful of the intention of State Council in establishing these two bodies:
    
    <subclause-letters>
    
    1. In many circumstances, the day to day political pronouncements of
        the Party are necessarily those of the Party’s elected
        representatives, and there should be maximum co-operation between
        the Committee and those representatives. Nevertheless, the
        campaign resources of the Party should at all times be directed in
        support of positions consistent with Party policy, and the
        Campaign Committee has a responsibility to ensure this is the
        case.

    1. The Campaign Committee’s (in full session) primary functions are the
        recommendation to State Council of overall strategy, ensuring that
        strategy is being implemented, amending strategy when necessary,
        financial compliance, budget management, selection of major
        contractors such as advertising agencies, proper governance, and
        effective communication within the Party. While it will be
        required to exercise its political authority where controversy
        arises within the Party about day to day management issues, the
        Campaign Committee oversees but does not participate in the day to
        day management of Campaign issues. In light of this, it would be
        expected that the Campaign Committee would meet monthly, and more
        often during an election campaign period.

    1. The Campaign Management Group is responsible to the Campaign
        Committee in full session for making day-to decisions about the
        content of campaigns and the allocation of resources under the
        control of the Campaign Committee. It would be convened by the
        Campaign Committee Convenor whenever the need arises, and it would
        be expected to meet at least several times each week during an
        election campaign period. It must report all of its decisions to
        the Campaign Committee and these must be included in the minutes
        of the next Campaign Committee meeting. The Campaign Management
        Group can direct the day-to-day priorities of the Campaign Staff
        through the most senior staff member.

    </subclause-letters>

[^1] The procedure for the election of the Convenor of the Campaign
Committee is outlined in Clause 54.1 of the AGV State Constitution and
is a ballot of all members of the AGV.
