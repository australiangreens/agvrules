# Preselection

## Definitions

Ballot: A ballot may be either postal, attendance or electronic or
combination of any of those options.

Snap Election: Any election for which the period from the announcement
to the date of the election is less than 8 calendar weeks. The minimum
federal election campaign period is 33 days.

Eligible Voters: For local government elections, all members residing in
the ward or the local government area, as decided by the preselecting
body. For all other elections, all members residing within the
electorate in question.

Ward/Electorate boundaries: The electoral (or ward) boundaries used for
selecting eligible voters will be:

a\) the boundaries that will be used at the election, if they have
been finalised and gazetted;
>
b\) otherwise, the current boundaries.

## Scope

1.  Notwithstanding any resolution of State Council which places any
    condition on any preselection, this bylaw determines the method of
    preselecting candidates, under clause 56.1 of the Constitution, for
    all electorates for the next Federal, State and Local elections.

2.  The purpose of preselection is to judge the desirability of a member
    as a candidate to represent the Party in an external election.

3.  When voting members should take into account the ability of the
    candidate:



1.  to work with a campaign team to achieve local and state goals and
    targets;

2.  to clearly articulate Greens’ value, policies and key campaign
    messages;

3.  to effectively represent Greens values and implement Greens policies
    when holding public office.

## Returning Officer

1.  The body conducting the preselection must appoint a Returning
    Officer, a position which may be shared by up to 2 people. Once
    appointed, the Returning Officer shall be responsible for
    conducting, and ensuring the proper conduct in accordance with the
    rules of, the preselection in question.

2.  The Returning Officer shall not be eligible to be a nominee for the
    preselection in question, or nominate any person for the
    preselection in question, or sit on the probity panel associated
    with the preselection in question.

3.  The Returning Officer will be the primary contact between nominees,
    candidates, any probity panel established and other Greens members
    making enquiries, for any election they are required to conduct.

4.  The Returning Officer may appoint up to 2 people to act as deputy
    returning officers to assist in the duties of the Returning Officer.
    Final authority and responsibility remains with the Returning
    Officer.

5.  Should a Returning Officer leave office before the preselection is
    complete the following will occur:



1.  If a Deputy Returning Officer had been previously appointed, the
    Deputy will retain full powers and responsibilities of the Returning
    Officer until the time the preselecting body chooses to appoint a
    new Returning Officer.

2.  If no Deputy Returning Officer has been appointed, the State
    Returning Officer will take carriage of the preselection until the
    time the preselecting body chooses to appoint a new Returning
    Officer.

3.  If there is no State Returning Officer, the preselecting body should
    within 72 hours convene a meeting to appoint a new Returning
    Officer, or appoint one via QDMG (should the preselecting body have
    a QDMG in place).

4.  If no appointment of a new Returning Officer has been made under
    this clause within 72 hours, then the Victorian Campaign Committee
    must appoint a Returning Officer as soon as possible thereafter to
    manage the preselection until the time that the preselecting body
    chooses to appoint a new Returning Officer.



1.  The Returning Officer will ensure that where the implementation of
    any election requires the use of AGV office resources, measures are
    taken to ensure that the most senior member of AGV staff is
    consulted, and that preselection materials (such as reply paid
    envelopes) are distinguished from those of any other election that
    may be occurring at the same time.

2.  The Returning Officer will be the final authority on the
    interpretation of the preselection rules.

## Nomination

1.  The Returning Officer will ensure the publication, to all eligible
    voters and linked to from the AGV e-bulletin, of the relevant dates
    and deadlines associated with the preselection (which shall include
    as a minimum the times of opening and closing of nominations and the
    deadline by which votes must be returned), and information for
    prospective candidates, which will be compliant with the
    Constitution.

2.  There will be at least 2 weeks between the opening and closing of
    nominations, and at least 2 weeks between the opening and closing of
    voting unless a Snap Election has been called (see below).

3.  For a nomination to be valid, nominees must be members of the AGV at
    the time of nomination, at the time of the vote count and during the
    entire relevant election period.

4.  To nominate for election, eligible members shall provide the
    Returning Officer with:



1.  Their nomination in a form prescribed by the Returning Officer,
    including an agreement to abide by the Code of Conduct, Tithing
    bylaw, and Confidential Information bylaw;

2.  A statement for eligible voters, of no more than 800 words, which
    shall include how long the member has been a member, the name of
    the Branch to which the member is registered, a brief list of
    positions held by the member within the party and previous
    candidacies for public office, and any other information the
    member sees fit to include, which should generally include the
    member’s political and philosophical positions on key issues
    facing the party and the position being elected;

3.  Statements of support of up to 200 words from four other members for
    the purposes of preselections for lead upper house Federal or
    State electorates, or from two other members for the purposes of
    all other preselections. Statements of support must not be
    provided by current AGV staff, State Office Bearers, campaign
    committee office bearers, candidates for public office, or elected
    representatives. Statements of support may include how long the
    supporting member has been a member, the name of the Branch to
    which the supporting member is registered, and any other
    information the supporting member may wish to include. The
    statement may be augmented by up to 75 words in order to include a
    brief list of positions held by the supporting member within the
    party, including previous candidacies for public office;

4.  A clear photo of themselves (optional);

5.  A signed Statutory Declaration attesting to the correctness of the
    Preselection and Probity Forms, and agreeing to a Police Check if
    the Returning Officer, Probity Panel, Victorian Campaign
    Committee, or State Executive deem it necessary;

6.  Nominees for federal elections only: A truthfully completed copy of
    the Australian Electoral Commission document regarding section 44
    of the *Commonwealth Constitution* called the ‘Qualification
    Checklist: Relating to Section 44 of the Constitution.’



1.  If, under exceptional circumstances, a printed and signed copy of
    the statutory declaration required in clause 14 cannot be provided
    by the nominee by the time of nomination, a digitally signed copy
    may be provided. Under such circumstances, signed copies must be
    provided within 4 weeks of submitting the nominations or until the
    exceptional circumstances pass. Exceptional circumstances will be
    decided by the Returning Officer.

2.  The Returning Officer must immediately submit any document received
    under clause 14(i) to the Victorian Campaign Committee (‘VCC’) which
    must decide (as quickly as reasonably possible) whether further
    enquiry is needed to determine whether a nominee is presently
    eligible to be nominated for election or is reasonably likely to be
    able to become eligible in the time before nominations are required.
    The _VCC_ may seek the assistance of appropriately qualified members
    in making this decision. If the VCC decides that further enquiry is
    needed, the Returning Officer, after having consulted with the VCC
    as to how long these enquiries are likely to take, may refuse the
    nomination or delay the preselection to allow such enquiries to be
    made The Returning Officer may, at any time, revisit a decision to
    delay the preselection.

3.  A nomination will normally be refused by the Returning Officer if
    the member has not provided the information in the previous clause
    by the published deadline. Otherwise, the Returning Officer will
    confirm with all prospective nominees the list of approved nominees.
    To avoid doubt the Returning Officer’s decision will be final.

## Conduct of Preselection

1.  Nominees may not discuss their nomination or the election in
    question with any journalist, other than to confirm their candidacy,
    with the exception of the AGV Convenor.

2.  Nominees may not expend funds for the purposes of communicating with
    eligible voters in relation to the election in question.

3.  Nominees shall receive from the Returning Officer;

    1.  A list of eligible members’ names, phone numbers and email
        addresses, and may instigate contact with each eligible voter

        purposes of discussing or promoting their nomination. The
        nominee must not show or distribute the list to any other
        person, and must destroy the list within one week of the
        declaration of the result of the election in question, or when
        the State Returning Officer has revoked nomination, whichever
        occurs first.

4.  Until the declaration of the result, nominees may not attend Party
    Body meetings other than those they are a member of, except to carry

    discuss their nomination for the election in question at that Branch
    meeting.

5.  Subject to the following, members are entitled to express their
    opinions on any nominees. However. any statements made in relation

    represent.

## Results

1.  Until such time as any preselection result is announced by the
    Returning Officer, nominees may not comment on the result publicly,
    nor may any other member of the Party.

2.  The declaration of any result of any election conducted by the State
    Returning Officer shall be final. Whilst in some circumstances the

    request.

## Snap Elections

1.  In the event of a snap election:



1.  all affected electorates are considered open for nominations where a
    candidate has not already been preselected for a future election,
    except where the Victorian Campaign Committee determines otherwise
    (for example if a particular preselection is about to be concluded
    anyway);

2.  the Victorian Campaign Committee:



1.  may exercise all the powers of State Council in relation to Chapter
    5 of the Constitution;

2.  will issue a call for nominations for all affected electorates for
    which a candidate has not already been preselected for a future
    election;

3.  will assist branches and other campaigning bodies with conducting
    preselections in the most timely manner possible but will in any
    regards have the ability to appoint by selection panel a candidate
    to represent the AGV to any electorate which remains unfilled 4
    days before the deadline for submitting candidate names to the
    relevant Electoral Commission.



1.  the State Returning Officer becomes the Returning Officer for any
    electorate for which a Returning Officer has not been appointed.
    They may, at their discretion, appoint Deputy Returning Officers
    to aid them in their duties. The requirements that Returning
    Officers, deputy or otherwise, remain uninvolved in other
    preselection matters must be observed.

2.  the Probity Panel will have until 48 hours after the close of
    nominations for preselection to conclude its duties.

3.  the default method of preselection will be assumed to be either
    electronic ballot or preselection panel. Other methods may be
    approved by the VCC on a case by case basis.

4.  a decision to appoint a candidate by preselection panel still
    requires concurrent decisions of the preselecting body and the
    VCC, or the VCC and the State Executive.

## Eligibility

1.  The AGV will not allow a candidate’s name to be submitted for
    nomination to the AEC for a federal election for any House of
    Representatives or Senate seat where the person has not demonstrated
    their eligibility to sit in the federal parliament according to
    section 44 of the Australian Constitution.

2.  In circumstances where a candidate may be under acknowledgement of
    allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a
    subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights and privileges of a
    subject or a citizen of a foreign power, the candidate must provide
    written confirmation of renunciation of any rights of citizenship.
    In cases where renunciation is not possible or practicable,
    comprehensive evidence of an attempt to renounce is required. The
    VCC will assess whether any evidence submitted is sufficient.

3.  At any time, the Victorian Campaign Committee may direct a
    preselected candidate for a federal election to answer questions in
    writing regarding their eligibility to be nominated for election. A
    refusal to comply with such a direction is sufficient grounds for
    disendorsement.

4.  A preselected candidate for a federal election must complete and
    submit the Australian Electoral Commission document regarding
    section 44 of the *Commonwealth Constitution* called the
    ‘Qualification Checklist: Relating to Section 44 of the
    Constitution’, should that form have changed in any way since the
    candidate completed it at the time of nominating for preselection.

## Diversity

1.  At the conclusion of general Federal, State or local government
    elections, the State Returning Officer(s) shall provide an
    aggregated anonymized report to State Council on the diversity of
    preselected candidates and elected candidates to the extent known.
