# Incidents Response

## Purpose

1. The Australian Greens Victoria (AGV) is committed to providing a
safe environment for all members, staff and volunteers. This requires
developing a party culture whereby all members, staff and volunteers
feel empowered to challenge unsafe behaviours when they see them, and to
report any incidents that impinge on safety and wellbeing in the
knowledge that they will be appropriately acted on.

2. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that we have systems,
processes and clear responsibilities across the AGV for managing
incidents.

3. The aim of this policy is to provide clarity on how to report and
respond to incidents.

## Scope

4. This policy applies to all people who conduct work for the AGV in a
paid or unpaid capacity, including members, staff and volunteers.

## Contact Persons

5. Contact persons are members who people can go to if they experience
or witness an incident that impinges on their or another person’s safety
and wellbeing, including sexual harassment and child abuse or neglect. 

6. All party bodies will appoint at least one contact person annually
for a term of one year, and whensoever a vacancy arises at any meeting,
event or activity. Party bodies should try to ensure that there are
contact persons of different genders<s>.</s>

7. A person may seek help from any contact person, not only a contact
person of the party body where the incident took place.

## Incident report

8. A person who experiences or witnesses an incident that impinges on
their or another person’s safety and wellbeing may report that incident
to a contact person. If there is any concerning behaviour between an
adult and a child, a person must report that to a contact person. If a
child is being abused or neglected, a person must report that to a
contact person who must then report that to the relevant authority,
including the police or the child protection service in the local area.

9. If an incident is reported, a contact person will – or any other
person who receives a report can – record the incident as outlined
below, and advise the person of any available options for resolution,
including the complaints process. 

10. The person will then immediately provide this record to the State
Convenor, State Secretary or the most senior staff member. 

## Incident Register

11. The State Secretary will record any incidents in an Incident
    Register, which will be kept confidentially and securely. Each incident
    report shall include:

    <subclause-letters>

    1. the date and time that the report was made; 

    1. the name and role of the person to whom the report was made; 

    1. with permission only, the name of the person reporting the incident;

    1. the date, time and location of the alleged incident; 

    1. details of the incident, including the nature and any parties involved; 

    1. whether there are any exceptional circumstances that require breaking confidentiality and reporting the matter as required by law; 

    1. the options discussed; and 

    1. any actions taken.
    
    </subclause-letters>

12. If there are any exceptional circumstances that require breaking
confidentiality and reporting the matter as required by law, the State
Secretary or their delegate shall do so, and include information about
this in the incident report.

13. If the incident requires further investigation, the State Secretary
or their delegate shall investigate the incident. They should refer any
incidents that may amount to misconduct to the Misconduct Panel and may
make changes to policies, procedures and practice in response to
incidents.

## Child safety and wellbeing

14. In any interaction with a child in the AGV, people are to behave
appropriately and in accordance with any relevant policy.

15. Any person must report immediately to the State Secretary any
factors in their own - or another person’s - circumstances or history
which may make it unsafe to have contact with a child, including all
charges and/or convictions of sexual abuse or neglect.

16. For the purposes of this policy, a **child** is defined as any
person under the age of 18.

## Related organisational policies and procedures

17. This policy should be read in conjunction with the party’s Code of
Conduct, complaints guide, risk management framework and any policy on
sexual harassment or child safety.

## Policy status and review

18. The AGV is committed to developing ever more effective systems for
managing incidents. This means all party bodies are responsible for
ensuring that this policy is implemented.

19. Every six months, the State Secretary or their delegate shall issue
an evaluation proforma to branches and working groups to track how they
are complying with this policy. The State Secretary or their delegate
will identify any systemic weaknesses and report on these to the State
Executive, including any recommended improvements.
