# Election Campaign Governance

## Scope and purpose

1.  This bylaw gives effect to clause 55.5 of the Constitution.

## Responsibility to direct campaigns

1.  The body with primary responsibility for directing the campaign for
    > each Victorian Legislative Assembly or Federal House of
    > Representatives seat is set out in schedule 1 of this bylaw.

2.  State Executive may amend schedule 1 to give effect to the following
    > principles:

    1.  If a single Branch overlaps with an electorate and is willing to
        direct the campaign then that Branch will be assigned the
        responsibility

    2.  If multiples Branches overlap with an electorate and at least
        one is willing to direct the campaign, then

        1.  if the Branches agree which of them should direct the
            campaign then that Branch will be assigned the
            responsibility

        2.  if the Branches disagree on which of them should direct the
            campaign then the Branch with the most members residing in
            the electorate on the last census date will be assigned the
            responsibility.

    3.  If no Branch overlaps with an electorate then responsibility may
        be assigned to a nearby Branch that volunteers for the task or
        to the Victorian Campaign Committee.

3.  A Branch with primary responsibility for the campaign in an
    > electorate may form an election campaign committee for the
    > management of the campaign for a given election period. The Branch
    > may allocate more than one electorate to the same committee.

4.  Should a Branch form an election campaign committee, it must:



1.  Before the first meeting of the committee – notify the Convenors and
    Secretaries of any other Branch that falls wholly or partly within
    the electorate/s overseen by the committee.

2.  Without unreasonable delay – notify the State Secretary, the State
    Treasurer and the Victorian Campaign Committee convenor of its
    formation, composition and office bearers.



1.  Regional campaign committees may be established in advance of any
    > State or Federal general election, either by State Council
    > deciding to establish a new regional campaign committee, or by
    > State Council permitting an existing Regional Council to also act
    > as a regional campaign committee. Where established, regional
    > campaign committees will:



1.  direct the campaign for any Victorian Legislative Council election
    within its remit;

2.  direct the campaign for any electorate which the responsible branch
    (as per Schedule 1) delegates to the regional campaign committee;

3.  facilitate cooperation between any Branches or campaign committees
    directing campaigns within its area; and

4.  abide by its terms of reference, as determined by State Council upon
    establishment.

## Campaign Coordinator

1.  All campaigns must appoint or elect a campaign coordinator under
    > section 55.7(a) of the constitution. This will normally be an
    > office bearer or a staff member employed to work with the
    > committee

2.  The Campaign Coordinator is responsible for coordinating campaign
    > activities.

3.  The Campaign Coordinator will generally be the primary contact
    > person for the campaign to the VCC, other AGV bodies and relevant
    > AGV staff.

4.  Upon appointment, the Campaign Coordinator should notify the VCC
    > Convenor of their appointment with appropriate contact details.

5.  The Branch or relevant campaign committee may delegate authority to
    > the campaign coordinator for particular operational activities
    > during the campaign, including expending funds up to a specified
    > limit.

## Powers and Responsibilities of Election Campaign Committees

1.  An election campaign committee will have the power and
    > responsibility to do the following in relation to the electorates
    > within its jurisdiction:

    1.  Conduct (but not determine the method of) preselection;

    2.  Develop the campaigning strategies, for endorsement by the
        > Branch. Strategies should complement and not contradict
        > endorsed strategies and decisions of the Victorian Campaign
        > Committee and State Council (and the National Council in the
        > case of Federal electorates);

    3.  Develop a campaign budget for endorsement by the Branch;

    4.  Make expenditure in line with the branch-endorsed budget and
        > campaign strategies and within delegated limits specified by
        > the Branch;

    5.  With the approval of the most senior staff member of the AGV,
        > conduct any staff employment process, noting however that only
        > the most senior staff member of the AGV may sign employment
        > contracts and that direction of any employed campaign staff
        > must be through the most senior staff member or their
        > delegate;

    6.  Establish, if it considers appropriate, a campaign management
        > team to coordinate the campaign on a day to day basis, and
        > delegate to that team clearly defined powers of the committee.
        > If a campaign management team is established, it will be
        > required to record its decisions and report in writing to each
        > meeting of the committee advising of all substantive decisions
        > it has made;

    7.  Contribute to a supportive and accountable environment for all
        > people volunteering or working on the campaign;

    8.  Manage local access and appropriate input to information systems
        > to maintain data integrity; and

    9.  Co-opt committee members in accordance with clause 16(g).

2.  Election campaign committees are at all times accountable for:

    1.  Ensuring financial management is undertaken in accordance with
        > the Financial Management and Reporting Bylaw;

    2.  Ensuring financial record keeping is undertaken in accordance
        > with clauses 55.7 and 55.8 of the Constitution and any advice
        > issued by the State Council or its standing committees;

    3.  Ensuring that donations received by the committee are managed in
        > accordance with the Donations and Loans Bylaw;

    4.  Providing all necessary information to the State Convenor, the
        > Secretary and the Treasurer, Party Agent and Registered
        > Officer for the purposes of compliance with relevant
        > Commonwealth or Victorian legislation; and

    5.  Complying with directives of the State Council and/or the
        > Victorian Campaign Committee.

3.  Election campaign committees must provide a written report within
    > two months of the conclusion of an election for the electorate/s
    > it covers to its constituent Branches and the Victorian Campaign
    > Committee, setting out the findings and recommendations of the
    > committee in relation to the campaign. The Victorian Campaign
    > Committee may direct that the written report take a particular
    > form.

4.  The election campaign committee will cease to exist two months after
    > an election, or when its final report has been produced, whichever
    > is sooner.
