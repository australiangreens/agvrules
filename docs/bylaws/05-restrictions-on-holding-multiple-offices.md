1.  In the previous clause, ‘staff’ is defined to mean those employed as
    staff, other than those employed on a short term temporary basis.

2.  Where another bylaw limits the holding of particular offices further
    than the provisions of this bylaw, the more limiting provisions will
    prevail.

3.  The act of nominating for the positions of State Convenor, State
    Secretary or Convenor of the Campaign Committee carries an implicit
    undertaking that the person so nominating shall not, during the
    following 12 months, nominate for pre-selection for:

    1.  The lead position on the Senate ticket, or the second position
        in respect of a double dissolution; or

    2.  The lead position on the ticket in a Legislative Council Region,
        or the second position in circumstances where the Party’s vote
        in that Region in the previous election exceeded 20%; or

    3.  Any state or federal seat in which the Party’s vote was more
        than 20% (or double the average vote for seats in Victoria in
        the most recent relevant general election, whichever is the
        lesser)

Should a State Convenor, State Secretary or Convenor of the Campaign
Committee nominate for preselection for endorsement for any of (a) to
(c) above, they shall thereby cease to hold that office.

1.  For the purpose of this bylaw, the holding of an office within the
    Party includes any holding of office on an acting basis.
