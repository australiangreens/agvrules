Such a meeting may be held in conjunction with any special meeting of State Council held because of the calling of an election. The Campaign Committee is responsible for determining the pre-selection process for Senate pre-selection and for directing the implementation of that process. Moreover, the Campaign Committee has the responsibility to ensure that other party bodies are carrying out pre-selection decisions, and for settling the date by which such decisions must be taken.

Once a procedural question is raised by a State Councillor, that State Councillor may briefly state a reason for raising it and the facilitator must then immediately ask State Councillors if there is any dissent to the procedural question being agreed to. Following this: if there is no dissent, the procedural question is agreed to; or if there is dissent, the facilitator may allow the reasons for dissent to be stated briefly, then must ask for a show of hands of State Councillors. A simple majority is required for the procedural question to be agreed to, with the exception of the procedural questions to put a proposal to a vote or to suspend Standing Orders, which require a 75% super majority for the procedural question to be agreed to. Procedural questions will only take the form of one of the following phrases or of those referred to elsewhere in these Standing Orders: “that time for discussion on the Proposal now expire” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the facilitator to immediately test for consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so on the Proposal, that is, to end any discussion immediately. It should not be used in an attempt to silence dissent, and generally should only be used if the time allotted to debate is nearing its end. “that the Proposal be considered at a later time this day” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the State Secretary to schedule time later in the day for further consideration of the Proposal at hand. “that the Proposal be considered at the next meeting” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the State Secretary to include the Proposal, in its exact form, on the agenda for the next State Council meeting. “that the matter be considered at the next meeting” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the State Secretary to schedule time on the agenda for the next State Council meeting for debate on the substantive matter at hand, but allows flexibility for the redrafting of any Proposals. “that the Proposal lapse” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to defeat, rather than defer, a Proposal, without first testing for consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so. It should only be put if it has become apparent that a decision on the matter is not required. “that Proposal [number] be now considered” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to consider a Proposal in a different order to that stated on the agenda. “that the Proposal be put to a vote” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to put the Proposal at hand to a vote. It should only be put for the reasons stated in the State Constitution; that is, that “if, after a reasonable period of time, disagreement persists and a decision cannot be deferred, the question will be resolved by vote.” 48.2: Except where this Constitution requires a decision to be made by consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so only, if, after a reasonable period of time, disagreement persists and a decision should not be deferred, the question of moving to a vote on a substantive motion will be resolved by vote. The procedural question to this effect will be deemed to have been carried if it is supported by at least a 75 per cent majority. “that the names and votes of State Councillors voting be recorded” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is for the names of those State Councillors voting for, against, or abstaining from the previous Proposal, to be recorded in the minutes. The procedural question must be put within five minutes of the facilitator declaring the outcome of the Proposal in question. In the event that the list of names by vote type contradicts the total recorded in the minutes, the totals will be amended to reflect the list. “that a Proposal regarding [very short description of substance of proposal] be considered” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is for State Council to consider a Proposal that did not appear on the agenda. “that consideration of this agenda item be extended for [number] minutes” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to extend time for discussion beyond the time allowed for in the agenda. “that the words ‘For report only’ be removed from the agenda” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to open discussion at a time when the agenda does not allow for open discussion (see Standing Orders: Discussion). In all but the most important of cases, State Councillors should only seek to have the words “For report only” removed from parts of the agenda at the beginning of the meeting. “that the ruling of the facilitator be overturned” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to overturn the facilitator’s most recent ruling on a procedural matter. It must only be raised in the most serious of cases. “that the facilitator step down” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the facilitator to step down, and for the State Convenor to choose another facilitator. It must only be raised in the most serious of cases. “that [Name] cease raising procedural questions” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to disallow any one State Councillor from raising procedural questions for the rest of the meeting. It must only be raised in the most serious of cases. “that the standing orders be suspended for [number] minutes to allow for [details of matter]” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to suspend the standing orders for a determined amount of time. “that the meeting go in camera to discuss [details of matter]” and, if necessary, “and that [observers’ names] be permitted to stay due to [short rationale]” The effect of this procedural question being agreed is for the meeting to go in camera and, if necessary, for certain observers to be permitted to stay. This procedural question should only be raised when absolutely necessary. Procedural questions will be minuted consistently as follows: A procedural question, “that [text of question]”, was [not] agreed to. Unlike for the recording of the outcomes of Proposals, if procedural questions are put to a vote by show of hands, votes, including abstentions, are not recorded in the minutes.","s":"Procedural questions","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/18-standing-orders-of-state-council/","h":"#procedural-questions","p":243},{"i":262,"t":"As far as reasonably practicable items listed for Discussion should fall into two categories: Items listed for short discussion, which generally should be: very limited in number; limited to 10 minutes duration; and either uncontroversial (e.g. a motion of thanks, which it would be inappropriate to put through without consideration) or necessary (e.g. because the information on which a recommendation could be based could only be available at the last minute, such as legal advice or a cost-quote, but where the matter was otherwise uncontroversial).

In addition a conflict of interest exists if the donor is likely to receive a material benefit from a reasonably foreseeable decision that could be made by the Partythe incorporated association referred to in clause 40(1) or an elected Green, unless such benefit is likely to occur as a result of the donor being a member of such a broad class of beneficiary that their individual benefit is not readily identifiable or known or distinguishable from other members of that class.

Never before have we had so many answers to the problems that have dogged our developing world. Solutions now exist that could greatly decrease the poverty, hunger and ill health of our fellow humans and we now have technologies to reduce and repair much of the ecological damage on our planet wrought by our industrial and agricultural activities. Clean air, clean water and ecological sustainability are possible. Yet this is not being done. World-wide, governments lack the political will to make the necessary adjustments that will bring an end to the conflict, pollution, poor health and social inequity that characterise our time. The Greens have evolved in this climate to show a new way forward. A Green response to the ecological crisis proceeds on the basis of a respect for all life, both human and non-human. We recognise the mutual interdependence between humanity and the rest of nature and we seek to move toward an ecologically sustainable path. We seek to eradicate poverty, oppression and discrimination and to build a society underpinned by values of participatory democracy, social justice, and the respect for cultural and ecological diversity. We aim to transform the political, social and economic structures that disempower and oppress people and to develop a rich, participatory cultural life that enables the flourishing of new democratic movements for progressive change. We believe that contesting elections is a necessary step towards the building of an ecologically sustainable and socially just society, but that it is by no means the only step. We recognise and seek to facilitate grassroots movements and community initiatives that are working towards ecological responsibility, social justice, affirmative action on behalf of groups who are discriminated against, Aboriginal land rights, peace, and Third World development. We seek to avoid parochialism and to cultivate a global, ecological consciousness and long-range perspective in order to safeguard the interests of both existing and future generations and non-human species. We believe Australia should play an active role in building a more co-operative and ecologically sustainable world that is capable of addressing the glaring disparities in energy and resource consumption and quality of life between the rich and poor.

Version as at [date approved by Consumer Affairs Victoria] Drafting Panel commentary Overview The constitution of a political partya political party registered under Commonwealth, state or territory law is its key governance document. An organisation consists of different people who will want different things and have different views. The constitution tells us how the members have decided that decisions will be made, how power is distributed and exercised, and who gets to decide what. Most people will agree that our Constitution needs to be both democratic – reflecting in some way the views of the membership – and effective – capable of giving effect to its objectives. Below is a thematic explanation of what is proposed. Where important, clauses are mentioned. The key elements of the proposed new structure are: A new State Council of 15 members elected by proportional representation by all members. Branches with – in practice – a largely unchanged role, but with the capacity to determine their own internal administrative structure. Mandatory participatory and deliberative processes for members to establish policies and the party strategy. Regular all-member forums. Mandatory and specific affirmative action provisions, and a guaranteed right of participation for First Nations members at the top level of the Partythe incorporated association referred to in clause 40(1). A much shorter and simpler document than we have now, leaving much more for party bodies and members to determine as needs arise. A system under which members who are unhappy with a decision (or non- decision) by the State Council can, through their branches, initiate a discussion of that issue involving all members, aimed at developing consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so, and in certain circumstances having the issue resolved by a vote of all members.

Provides for members to be branch members. Sets out branch responsibilities and powers. Empowers branches to delegate their powers. Provides ways for branches to hold State Council to account, including the power to make joint branch proposals leading to a possible members’ meeting and members’ plebiscite. Provides for the suspension of branches. Schedule 1 provides Branch meeting procedures. Summary and Explanation This part largely reflects the current arrangements, with the exception that some of the administrative and office-bearer requirements in the current Constitution have been removed. For example, a small branch might choose to have only a Convenor/Secretary, or a ‘Coordinator’, rather than having the full suite of office bearer positions. State Council retains the power to establish and disestablish branches but would now require the agreement of the relevant branches to redefine a branch area. The default position is that a branch must be defined by local government boundaries (clause 7(4) (c)). Clause 8 defines branch membership, which is essentially unchanged but is clarified. Clause 9 sets out the powers of branches, including powers to make local policies and engage with the community. Branch decisions are subject to contrary State Council decisions, and State Council may, but only temporarily, suspend the power of a branch to make public statements. Clause 12 adds a new power for branches to formally submit a question to State Council and receive an answer within 60 days. Clause 13 creates new powers for branches to propose a reconsideration proposala proposal that a resolution of State Council or a senior party body be rescinded – to propose to State Council that it rescind a State Council or senior party bodya party body given that status under clause 19(3) decision they don’t like. A branch can also forward a substantive proposalany proposal that is not a procedural or reconsideration proposal. If they do this, State Council must consider what they have put forward, and if State Council does not agree, it must explain why in writing. State Council can adopt a reconsideration proposala proposal that a resolution of State Council or a senior party body be rescinded by a simple majority. An example of a reconsideration-proposal in practice is: State Council decides by consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so in June to establish a Committee on Rural Policya statement of principle and intent about what government should do; North-East Victoria Branch moves a reconsideration proposala proposal that a resolution of State Council or a senior party body be rescinded in July because it thinks its voice was not heard, and this new Committee will undermine the role of the Country Greens Network; State Council, at its August meeting is divided, but votes 8 to 7 in favour of rescinding its earlier decision so it can consider the matter further; any further decision is made in the ordinary way. This makes it easier for branches to have the State Council reconsider a matter when it may not have heard directly from a branch at an earlier meeting.

State Council will pass bylaws which specify the scope and coverage of Branches established under this Constitution. Census Date and Representational Matters​ The State Executive will appoint a person or establish a committee prior to 31 January in each year, which will be responsible for: 1. ascertaining the numbers of Members and the Branch if any they are registered to on a census date of 1 March in that year; 2. determining the number, under this Constitution, of Branch (including regional) Representatives who will be elected to State Council; and 3. determining the placement of each Branch within the 8 Legislative Council regions for the purpose of electing further Branch Representatives to State Council, where appropriate. In determining the number of Members as at 1 March of each year, the person or committee will receive all necessary support from AGVAustralian Greens Victoria constituent groups, to enable that person or committee to report to the State Executive by 31 March in each year. The person or committee will: prepare a draft report by 13 March setting out the names and numbers of all AGVAustralian Greens Victoria members and the Branch to which each is registered to if applicable and, separately: 1. specifying whether or not each Branch qualifies as being entitled to elect a Branch Representative to the State Council at its Annual General Meeting in accordance with clause 40.2(a); 2. determining the Legislative Council region each Branch falls into, for the purposes of clause 40.2(b), which shall be the Legislative Council region that a plurality of members of the Branch reside within, subject to Schedule 1 where there is more than one Branch in a Local Government Area; and 3. determining the total number of Representatives who will represent Branches from each notional Legislative Council region on the State Council, as described in clause40.2; forward relevant sections of the draft report to all Branches for comment, not less than14. days before their scheduled consideration by the State Executive; consider Branch comment which is received not less than 7 days before the report’s scheduled consideration by the State Executive; provide to the State Executive an updated draft report which includes any amendments suggested by a Branch, or if such amendment is not included the Branch comment will be included as an appendix. Upon receiving the updated draft report the State Executive will, by 31 March, either endorse it or amend it to reflect comments made by a Branch or to correct any error. Upon endorsing it and by 7 April, the State Executive will release the report to State Council members, and the relevant portions of the report to Branches, and the findings of that report will be binding on those Branches, and on all Returning Officers appointed to oversight the filling of relevant positions. Any new Branch formed after the census date with 15 or more Members will be entitled to one Branch Representative on State Council. This will not affect any other representation on State Council until the next elections for State Council representatives. AGVAustralian Greens Victoria Office Bearers​ The Office Bearers of the AGVAustralian Greens Victoria will be the Convenor, Secretary, Treasurer, and an Assistant Secretary, who will hold such office for the purposes of the Party and the State Council and Executive. Office Bearers will be AGVAustralian Greens Victoria Members who are resident in Victoria. The powers and duties of Office Bearers are defined within this Constitution. Office Bearer positions may be held on a job-share basis. Job-share Office Bearers will make arrangements with the Executive for the apportioning of duties and responsibilities. Wherever this Constitution specifies the attendance of a particular Office Bearers as a quorum requirement for a meeting, the attendance of one of the job-share Office Bearers will be sufficient to satisfy such a requirement. Job-share Office Bearer positions will be entitled to one vote only. On any question on which the job-share Office Bearers differ, and both exercise their right to vote, their votes will cancel each other out. An individual elected to any Office Bearer position ceases to be an Office Bearer if the individual: 1. ceases to be an AGV Member; 2. resigns in writing; or 3. is suspended by the State Council because the individual is unable or unwilling to act to fulfil their designated responsibilities. Where an Office Bearer, or a Victorian Campaign Committee Convenor or a Policy Convenor, who holds a position on a job-share basis ceases to hold office but the other person who also holds that position does not cease to hold office, then the remaining holder of that office holds office until the end of the next meeting of the State Council, which shall at that meeting make a determination to either: 1. confirm the remaining holder of the position as the only holder of that position, in a secret ballot vote which shall require 75% of votes cast to be in favour; or 2. confirm a nomination made by the remaining holder of that position, of another member to fill the vacancy and serve in the position on a job-share basis, in a vote requiring75. % of votes cast to be in favour. In the absence of the occurrence of 1. or 2. at that meeting, the position becomes vacant. Election of State Office Bearers​ State Office Bearer will be elected annually by postal or electronic ballot of all AGVAustralian Greens Victoria Members prior to the Annual Conference. If any Office Bearer position remains unfilled after the annual postal or electronic ballot for any reason, that position may be elected by all AGVAustralian Greens Victoria Members present at the Annual Conference or at a Special State Conference. If elected at a State Conference, State Office Bearers will be elected by consensus or, failing this consensus, they will be elected by a secret ballot of all AGVAustralian Greens Victoria Members present at the State Conference. Any vote will be by an optional preferential system and will include an option to ‘seek further candidates’ rather than requiring election of one of the candidates. A person to be appointed as State Secretary must have attained the age of eighteen years, not be a holder of any public office, and be and remain a resident of Australia. State Office Bearers are elected for a term of one year or until the next Annual State Conference. An individual who has served three consecutive terms (or parts thereof) in any combination of State Office Bearer positions will not be eligible for re-election as an Office Bearer at the next election but will in any case be eligible for subsequent elections. These provisions can be waived by consensus decision of State Council. Candidates for State Office Bearer positions will have given their consent to the Members (or State Conference, if appropriate), in person or in writing, to standing for such office. If a casual vacancy for any State Office Bearer position occurs more than three months before the term of office was due to end, a postal or electronic vote of all AGVAustralian Greens Victoria Members or a Special State Conference must be held to fill the vacant position, save that where a single nomination is received for the casual vacancy then State Council may appoint that person to fill the position without the need for any postal or electronic ballot or any Special State Conference. If at any time a State Office Bearer position is vacant, the State Council will, within fourteen days after the vacancy arises, appoint an acting State Office Bearer from the existing members of State Council, who will: 1. have the same powers and responsibilities as an elected State Office Bearer until a new duly-elected Office Bearer is installed; and 2. cease to be an acting State Office Bearer when a new duly-elected State Office Bearer has been installed.

Purpose​ The purpose of this Chapter is to provide a flexible arrangement for those Branches or groups of Branches that wish to retain a structure above the level of the Branch, to coordinate Branch responsibilities within a defined area of Victoria in conjunction with and on behalf of those Branches. Definitions​ In this Chapter, the following terms have the specific meanings given below: ‘Upper House Region’ means the geographic region corresponding with a single electoral region for the Victorian Legislative Council; ‘Region’ means a geographic area in respect of which a Regional Council has been established under this Chapter; ‘Members of a Region’ means the Members of Branches within the relevant Region, and in the case of a Region in respect of which a Regional Council is created under clause 35.1(a), includes AGVAustralian Greens Victoria Members who reside within the relevant Upper House Region who are not Members of any Branch. Establishment of a Regional Council​ A Regional Council is established whenever either 1. or 2. following occurs: When both a majority of Branches, and Branches representing a majority of Members, located within an Upper House Region resolve in the same12. month period to establish a Regional Council in respect of that Region. For the purposes of this clause, a Branch whose boundaries include parts of more than one Upper House Region will be deemed to be a Branch within the Upper House Region in which the majority of the Branch’s members reside on the most recent census date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Branch may chose not to join with other Branches in creating a Regional Council under this provision. When two or more Branches with geographically adjacent jurisdictions both (or all) resolve in the same12. month period to establish a Regional Council in respect of their combined geographic jurisdiction, provided that a Regional Council has not already been established under paragraph 1. that covers one or more of those Branches. A Regional Council is dissolved when a majority of Branches within the Region, or Branches representing a majority of AGVAustralian Greens Victoria Members within the Region, resolve to that effect within a 12 month period. Composition and Powers​ The bylaws may govern the composition and method of election of a Regional Council, provided that a Regional Council must include (and will include if no bylaw is in force) a Convenor, a Secretary and a Treasurer elected by Members of the Region, one representative from each Branch within the Region elected by the Members of that Branch, and any Representatives to State Council from the Region, or from Branches within the Region. Unless the bylaws prescribe otherwise, and subject to the specific provisions of this Chapter: the procedures for elections, the holding of an Annual General Meeting, the procedure at meetings, duties and powers of Office Bearers, financial, audit and banking provisions, failure to operate, reporting requirements, Quick Decision Making Groups, and the conduct of business generally of Regions will apply to Regional Councils in the same way as they apply (with the necessary changes) to Branches under this Constitution. In addition to the role Regional Office Bearers have under 1. above, each of them will have the responsibility to liaise with Branches within their Region about matters within their responsibility, and specifically to liaise with the corresponding Office Bearer of each Branch. Regional Office Bearer positions may be held on a job-share basis, in which case clauses15. .5,15. .6 and15. .7 shall apply as though ‘Office Bearers’ means ‘Regional Office Bearers’ and ‘Executive’ means ‘Regional Council’. Any reference to any requirement for any Office Bearer or Party body to advise, inform or consult any Branch will also apply to a Regional Council in the same terms. The powers and functions of a Regional Council are: To establish and dissolve Regional Working Groups; Until the next Regional AGMAnnual General Meeting, to fill casual vacancies in the positions of Convenor, Secretary, Treasurer and any other positions established under the bylaws, and where the Regional Council has resolved to have all State Council representatives elected by all members of participating Branches in the Region under clause 37 below, to fill any casual vacancy in the position of such a representative; To suspend Regional Office Bearers and appoint acting Regional Office Bearers until the next Regional AGMAnnual General Meeting; To engage such persons under such conditions as the Regional Council may from time to time determine, subject to any bylaws established by State Council and the approval of the State Secretary; Subject to clause 64, to make arrangements with the State Treasurer for the Regional Council to open and operate bank accounts in the name of The Greens Victoria Inc.; Subject to clause 64, to make arrangements with the State Treasurer for AGVAustralian Greens Victoria Members in the Region and the Regional Council to incur debts in the name of The Greens Victoria Inc. up to a limit specified by the State Treasurer; To review the operations of working groups and election campaign committees, including receiving reports from each working group or election campaign committee at each Regional Council meeting, unless otherwise specified; To co-ordinate the work of Branches within the Region. Notwithstanding the powers specified as applicable to Branches under clause 24.1(a), (e), (g), (j), (l), a Branch within a Region will not act contrary to a decision of the relevant Regional Council dealing with that matter. A Regional Council may be made a regional campaign committee under section55. of the Constitution. Representation on State Council​ Where a Regional Council is established under this Chapter, it may determine, after asking each Branch within the Region to express a view, that notwithstanding the provisions of section40. of the Constitution, all the Representatives to State Council from the Region will be elected in one ballot from all the members of the Region. In this case, the number of Representatives so elected will be the same as it would be under section40. had such a decision not been made. A Regional Council may revoke a determination made under clause 37.1. A determination under clause 37 .1 or a revocation under clause 37.2 has effect from the next ordinary election for State Council representatives.

Summary and Explanation This part of the Constitution sets out what happens if members are unhappy with a decision (or non-decision) of State Council and want to have the decision made by the membership instead. The proposal cannot go forward if it deals with certain limited matters set out in Schedule 2, item 2 (e.g. to employ or not employ or dismiss a particular person, or to buy real estate). This procedure is best explained by an example. Example: if some members were opposed to a $25,000 cut in our contributions to the Australian Greensthe Australian Greens (The Greens) Incorporated, incorporated under the *Associations Incorporation Act 1991* (ACT) with association number A02626, as decided by State Council, what could they do? They could get three of our branches to each adopt a resolutiona proposal that was passed proposing to reverse the cut (Schedule 2, item 1) and appoint a delegate of the branch. State Council would then have to decide whether or not to agree with what the three branches proposed (Schedule 2, item 3). If State Council did what they wanted, that would be the end of the process. If the State Council did not agree to what the three branches wanted, the three delegates of the three Branches could require that a members’ meeting be called (Schedule 2, item 4). The issue and the proposal of the three branches then goes to a meeting open to all members (Schedule 3, Item 2) . The quorum is 50 members, and if that is not reached, the matter goes to another meeting (i.e. a second attempt) within 14 days. The purpose of the meeting is to attempt to develop a consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so resolutiona proposal that was passed of the issue. If that consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so is reached, the decision binds the Partythe incorporated association referred to in clause 40(1). For example, there might be consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so that a cut of only $10,000 to our contribution will apply. The meeting can decide a number of things if consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so cannot be reached, or if members decide to deal with the matter in particular ways (Schedule 3, Item 2). These include: The members might think the matter had no merit or should not go further – two thirds present and voting can vote to stop further consideration of the matter. Members could decide to convene another meeting to consider the issue further – a majority present and voting could vote to do this. The members could decide to adopt a (non-binding) resolutiona proposal that was passed – requiring a two-thirds majority and 67 in favour (e.g., ‘this meeting recommends to State Council that the cut in contributions be reversed next financial yearThe financial year of the Party is the year ending on 30 June.’). Members could vote to hold a members’ plebiscite on a question, but only if there were enough members who wanted this. Therefore, this would need two-thirds to vote in favour but also at least 67 members in favour. If the members’ meeting cannot reach consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so, and the meeting decides to send a proposal to a members’ plebiscite, then subject to various procedural requirements, the proposal is sent to all branches, and members get to vote, as individuals, if they have attended their branch meeting or another meeting held by the Constitutional Votes Committee to consider the merits of the proposal. Proposals are not carried unless at least: 60% of members vote in favour, and the number of votes in favour exceeds the number opposed by at least 3% of the membership (currently around 125)— however, the vote fails if a majority of members voting in a majority of branches vote against. If a proposal is carried, it is binding upon the State Council for 1 year.","s":"Schedule 3: Members’ direct decision-making","u":"/agvrules/new-constitution/schedule-03-members-direct-decision-making/","h":"","p":734},{"i":737,"t":"In this Schedule: branch delegate has the meaning given in Schedule 2; Committee means the Constitutional Votes Committee; issue has the meaning given in Schedule 2; joint branch proposal has the meaning given in Schedule 2; meeting means members’ meeting; permitted proposal has the meaning given in Schedule 2; and plebiscite means members’ plebiscite.","s":"Definitions","u":"/agvrules/new-constitution/schedule-03-members-direct-decision-making/","h":"#definitions","p":734},{"i":739,"t":"The purpose of a meeting is to: consider the joint branch proposal and the issue; and reach consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so. 📅When calculating a period of days under this Constitution, the period from 24 December to 9 January is excluded.

As well as reconsideration proposals by branches (discussed above), there are two types of proposal which can be put to State Council: procedural proposals (about how the meeting runs) which require a simple majority (50% +1) to pass, and substantive proposals which can only be put to a vote if the discussion has failed to reach consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so and the matter should not be deferred.

Sets out the procedure for members’ direct decision-making meetings and members’ plebiscites. Aims to ensure that the State Council cannot actthe Associations Incorporation Reform Act 2012 (or fail to actthe Associations Incorporation Reform Act 2012) in a manner which is clearly against the will of the membership. Summary and Explanation This part of the Constitution sets out what happens if members are unhappy with a decision (or non-decision) of State Council and want to have the decision made by the membership instead. The proposal cannot go forward if it deals with certain limited matters set out in Schedule 2, item 2 (e.g. to employ or not employ or dismiss a particular person, or to buy real estate). This procedure is best explained by an example. Example: if some members were opposed to a $25,000 cut in our contributions to the Australian Greensthe Australian Greens (The Greens) Incorporated, incorporated under the *Associations Incorporation Act 1991* (ACT) with association number A02626, as decided by State Council, what could they do? They could get three of our branches to each adopt a resolutiona proposal that was passed proposing to reverse the cut (Schedule 2, item 1) and appoint a delegate of the branch. State Council would then have to decide whether or not to agree with what the three branches proposed (Schedule 2, item 3). If State Council did what they wanted, that would be the end of the process. If the State Council did not agree to what the three branches wanted, the three delegates of the three Branches could require that a members’ meeting be called (Schedule 2, item 4). The issue and the proposal of the three branches then goes to a meeting open to all members (Schedule 3, Item 2) . The quorum is 50 members, and if that is not reached, the matter goes to another meeting (i.e. a second attempt) within 14 days. The purpose of the meeting is to attempt to develop a consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so resolutiona proposal that was passed of the issue. If that consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so is reached, the decision binds the Partythe incorporated association referred to in clause 40(1). For example, there might be consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so that a cut of only $10,000 to our contribution will apply. The meeting can decide a number of things if consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so cannot be reached, or if members decide to deal with the matter in particular ways (Schedule 3, Item 2). These include: The members might think the matter had no merit or should not go further – two thirds present and voting can vote to stop further consideration of the matter. Members could decide to convene another meeting to consider the issue further – a majority present and voting could vote to do this. The members could decide to adopt a (non-binding) resolutiona proposal that was passed – requiring a two-thirds majority and 67 in favour (e.g., ‘this meeting recommends to State Council that the cut in contributions be reversed next financial yearThe financial year of the Party is the year ending on 30 June.’). Members could vote to hold a members’ plebiscite on a question, but only if there were enough members who wanted this. Therefore, this would need two-thirds to vote in favour but also at least 67 members in favour. If the members’ meeting cannot reach consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so, and the meeting decides to send a proposal to a members’ plebiscite, then subject to various procedural requirements, the proposal is sent to all branches, and members get to vote, as individuals, if they have attended their branch meeting or another meeting held by the Constitutional Votes Committee to consider the merits of the proposal. Proposals are not carried unless at least: 60% of members vote in favour, and the number of votes in favour exceeds the number opposed by at least 3% of the membership (currently around 125)— however, the vote fails if a majority of members voting in a majority of branches vote against. If a proposal is carried, it is binding upon the State Council for 1 year.","s":"Schedule 2: Joint branch proposal to State Council","u":"/agvrules/new-constitution/schedule-02-joint-branch-proposal-to-state-council/","h":"","p":790},{"i":793,"t":"A joint branch proposal may be submitted to State Council (joint branch proposal). 📅When calculating a period of days under this Constitution, the period from 24 December to 9 January is excluded.

Summary and Explanation The current State Council (which is the committee of management of the Partythe incorporated association referred to in clause 40(1)) has some 70 odd members. Of these, 51 are elected one-per-branch, only at branch meetings. Nine are appointed by State and Federal MPs and local councillors. Four office bearers and the convenors of the Policya statement of principle and intent about what government should do and Campaign Committees are elected by all members. Finally, a number of positions are elected by members of the Upper House regions with proportionately more members (presently Southern and Northern Metro). There is also a State Executive (the office bearers, etc., plus 7 members elected by and from State Council), all of whose decisions must be ratified by State Council. Nearly all positions are elected annually. It is proposed that this be replaced by a State Council with 15 members. All 15 would be elected by proportional representation by the entire membership for a two-year term, with 7 elected one year and 8 elected the next. Every second year there would be an electronic vote of all members, and in the other years the election would be from all members but with a requirement that members attend an election deliberation sessiona discussion of: the issues facing the Party and how they should be addressed; the strengths and weaknesses of the current State Council; the merits of the candidates in addressing those. at a branch meeting or online before they can cast their ballota secret ballot that uses a single transferable vote quota-preferential voting system, allows the option of not allocating further preferences, uses Robson Rotation, and provides an option of voting to ‘Seek Further Candidates’ (see Schedule 6). This vote does not need to be cast at the meeting. An election deliberation sessiona discussion of: the issues facing the Party and how they should be addressed; the strengths and weaknesses of the current State Council; the merits of the candidates in addressing those. is a discussion of (see Schedule 6, item 6): the issues facing the Partythe incorporated association referred to in clause 40(1) and how they should be addressed the strengths and weaknesses of the current State Council; and the merits of the candidates in addressing those.
