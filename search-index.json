Public duty. It is the duty of members of The Greens to uphold the Greens Charter and promote our policies. It is the public duty of elected representatives and other officials of The Greens to represent their constituents impartially and act without undue influence in the community interest. Private interests. Candidates, elected representatives and other officials of The Greens are the beneficiaries of political donations directly or to the Party and hence have a private interest in those donations. They could be, or could be reasonably perceived to be, influenced by donations (and a desire to maintain them) in the conduct of their public duties. In general larger donations have a greater potential to give rise to the perception of a conflict of interest. Conflict. Conflict arises where decisions are actually, potentially or perceived to be made against the public interest and/or duty as a result of private interests. In addition a conflict of interest exists if the donor is likely to receive a material benefit from a reasonably foreseeable decision that could be made by the Party or an elected Green, unless such benefit is likely to occur as a result of the donor being a member of such a broad class of beneficiary that their individual benefit is not readily identifiable or known or distinguishable from other members of that class. A conflict of interest also still exists where a donation is received from a third party or associated entity related to the individual or entity where the conflict of interest originates.","s":"Conflict of Interest:","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/24-donations-and-loans-not-from-financial-institutions/","h":"#conflict-of-interest","p":281},{"i":289,"t":"Action Body Date Approved State Executive 2007-05-10 Amended State Executive 2009-05-28 Amended State Council 2013-05-04 Amended State Executive 2013-06-20 Amended State Executive 2013-07-14 Amended State Council 2015-07-25","s":"Modification History","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/24-donations-and-loans-not-from-financial-institutions/","h":"#modification-history","p":281},{"i":291,"t":"On this page","s":"AGVAustralian Greens Victoria Constituent Bodies Financial Management and Reporting","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/22-agv-constituent-bodies-financial-management-and-reporting/","h":"","p":290},{"i":293,"t":"The conduct, recording and reporting of all financial transactions shall be in accordance with standards and procedures as set from time to time by the AGVAustralian Greens Victoria State Treasurer and as documented in the AGVAustralian Greens Victoria “Victorian Treasurer’s Handbook for Party Bodies”.# Party bodies shall notify the AGVAustralian Greens Victoria State Treasurer within seven days of any change in treasurer.# For the purposes of this bylaw, ‘party body’ includes a branch, regional council or regional campaign committee.#","s":"General Financial Operations","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/22-agv-constituent-bodies-financial-management-and-reporting/","h":"#general-financial-operations","p":290},{"i":295,"t":"The maximum petty cash balance that a party body can hold is $100.

Version as at [date approved by Consumer Affairs Victoria] Drafting Panel commentary Overview The constitution of a political partya political party registered under Commonwealth, state or territory law is its key governance document. An organisation consists of different people who will want different things and have different views. The constitution tells us how the members have decided that decisions will be made, how power is distributed and exercised, and who gets to decide what. Most people will agree that our Constitution needs to be both democratic – reflecting in some way the views of the membership – and effective – capable of giving effect to its objectives. Below is a thematic explanation of what is proposed. Where important, clauses are mentioned. The key elements of the proposed new structure are: A new State Council of 15 members elected by proportional representation by all members.# Branches with – in practice – a largely unchanged role, but with the capacity to determine their own internal administrative structure.# Mandatory participatory and deliberative processes for members to establish policies and the party strategy.# Regular all-member forums.# Mandatory and specific affirmative action provisions, and a guaranteed right of participation for First Nations members at the top level of the Partythe incorporated association referred to in clause 40(1).# A much shorter and simpler document than we have now, leaving much more for party bodies and members to determine as needs arise.# A system under which members who are unhappy with a decision (or non- decision) by the State Council can, through their branches, initiate a discussion of that issue involving all members, aimed at developing consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so, and in certain circumstances having the issue resolved by a vote of all members.# A Constitutional Votes Committee responsible for the integrity of elections and for member votes under the Constitution.#","s":"index","u":"/agvrules/proposed-constitution/","h":"","p":456},{"i":459,"t":"Acknowledgement of Country The Australian Greens Victoria: Acknowledges First Nations peoples as the custodians of Country.
