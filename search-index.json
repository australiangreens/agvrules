Public duty. It is the duty of members of The Greens to uphold the Greens Charter and promote our policies. It is the public duty of elected representatives and other officials of The Greens to represent their constituents impartially and act without undue influence in the community interest. Private interests. Candidates, elected representatives and other officials of The Greens are the beneficiaries of political donations directly or to the Party and hence have a private interest in those donations. They could be, or could be reasonably perceived to be, influenced by donations (and a desire to maintain them) in the conduct of their public duties. In general larger donations have a greater potential to give rise to the perception of a conflict of interest. Conflict. Conflict arises where decisions are actually, potentially or perceived to be made against the public interest and/or duty as a result of private interests. In addition a conflict of interest exists if the donor is likely to receive a material benefit from a reasonably foreseeable decision that could be made by the Party or an elected Green, unless such benefit is likely to occur as a result of the donor being a member of such a broad class of beneficiary that their individual benefit is not readily identifiable or known or distinguishable from other members of that class.
