Public duty. It is the duty of members of The Greens to uphold the Greens Charter and promote our policies. It is the public duty of elected representatives and other officials of The Greens to represent their constituents impartially and act without undue influence in the community interest. Private interests. Candidates, elected representatives and other officials of The Greens are the beneficiaries of political donations directly or to the Party and hence have a private interest in those donations. They could be, or could be reasonably perceived to be, influenced by donations (and a desire to maintain them) in the conduct of their public duties. In general larger donations have a greater potential to give rise to the perception of a conflict of interest. Conflict. Conflict arises where decisions are actually, potentially or perceived to be made against the public interest and/or duty as a result of private interests. In addition a conflict of interest exists if the donor is likely to receive a material benefit from a reasonably foreseeable decision that could be made by the Party or an elected Green, unless such benefit is likely to occur as a result of the donor being a member of such a broad class of beneficiary that their individual benefit is not readily identifiable or known or distinguishable from other members of that class. A conflict of interest also still exists where a donation is received from a third party or associated entity related to the individual or entity where the conflict of interest originates.","s":"Conflict of Interest:","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/24-donations-and-loans-not-from-financial-institutions/","h":"#conflict-of-interest","p":333},{"i":341,"t":"Action Body Date Approved State Executive 2007-05-10 Amended State Executive 2009-05-28 Amended State Council 2013-05-04 Amended State Executive 2013-06-20 Amended State Executive 2013-07-14 Amended State Council 2015-07-25","s":"Modification History","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/24-donations-and-loans-not-from-financial-institutions/","h":"#modification-history","p":333},{"i":343,"t":"On this page","s":"Mutual Responsibilities Between Elected Representatives and Party Bodies, Officers and Members","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/27-mutual-responsibilities-between-elected-representatives-and-party-bodies-officers-and-members/","h":"","p":342},{"i":345,"t":"The reporting arrangements need not be mechanical or prescriptive, but must ensure that:# in the case of public office-holders, the relevant bodies are provided with a verbal report (default) or written report (if attendance is not possible), which should aim to cover:# main activities undertaken;# key decisions made as a public office-holder;# major issues which are pending;# the planned approach to these issues; and# issues in which they are involved where their position is likely to involve considerable public controversy or are likely to be controversial within the Party.

An organisation consists of different people who will want different things and have different views. The constitution tells us how the members have decided that decisions will be made, how power is distributed and exercised, and who gets to decide what. Most people will agree that our Constitution needs to be both democratic – reflecting in some way the views of the membership – and effective – capable of giving effect to its objectives. Below is a thematic explanation of what is proposed. Where important, clauses are mentioned. The key elements of the proposed new structure are: A new State Council of 15 members elected by proportional representation by all members.# Branches with – in practice – a largely unchanged role, but with the capacity to determine their own internal administrative structure.# Mandatory participatory and deliberative processes for members to establish policies and the party strategy.# Regular all-member forums.# Mandatory and specific affirmative action provisions, and a guaranteed right of participation for First Nations members at the top level of the Partythe incorporated association referred to in clause 40(1).# A much shorter and simpler document than we have now, leaving much more for party bodies and members to determine as needs arise.# A system under which members who are unhappy with a decision (or non- decision) by the State Council can, through their branches, initiate a discussion of that issue involving all members, aimed at developing consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so, and in certain circumstances having the issue resolved by a vote of all members.# A Constitutional Votes Committee responsible for the integrity of elections and for member votes under the Constitution.#","s":"index","u":"/agvrules/proposed-constitution/","h":"","p":548},{"i":551,"t":"On this page","s":"Chapter 7 — Party Administration","u":"/agvrules/constitution/party-administration/","h":"","p":550},{"i":553,"t":"There will be an incorporated association (formed under the Associations Incorporation Act 1981 ) to act as trustee for the AGVAustralian Greens Victoria in all financial matters.# The incorporated association will be known as The Greens Victoria Inc.# The State Council and Branches will conduct all their financial transactions through The Greens Victoria Inc.# As part of its charter, The Greens Victoria Inc. will hold in trust all funds and property belonging to the AGVAustralian Greens Victoria, in accordance with this Constitution.# The State Office Bearers of the AGVAustralian Greens Victoria will automatically be nominated as Office Bearers of The Greens Victoria Inc.# The State Council may nominate other persons with the relevant expertise to assist in the management of The Greens Victoria Inc.# The State Council will decide on mechanisms by which AGVAustralian Greens Victoria finances are managed.#","s":"The Greens Victoria Inc.","u":"/agvrules/constitution/party-administration/","h":"#the-greens-victoria-inc","p":550},{"i":555,"t":"The AGVAustralian Greens Victoria will have a Common Seal on which the name of The Greens Victoria Inc. will appear in legible characters.# The Common Seal will not be used without the express written authority of the State Council and every use of the Seal will be recorded by the State Secretary.# The Common Seal must only be affixed by the State Secretary and duly witnessed by another State Office Bearer.# The Common Seal will be kept in the custody of the State Secretary.#","s":"The Common Seal","u":"/agvrules/constitution/party-administration/","h":"#the-common-seal","p":550},{"i":557,"t":"The AGVAustralian Greens Victoria is an organisation registered with both the Australian and Victorian Electoral Commissions, whereas the AGVAustralian Greens Victoria is also a member party of the Australian Greens, a party also registered with the Australian Electoral Commission.
