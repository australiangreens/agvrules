Public duty. It is the duty of members of The Greens to uphold the Greens Charter and promote our policies. It is the public duty of elected representatives and other officials of The Greens to represent their constituents impartially and act without undue influence in the community interest. Private interests. Candidates, elected representatives and other officials of The Greens are the beneficiaries of political donations directly or to the Party and hence have a private interest in those donations. They could be, or could be reasonably perceived to be, influenced by donations (and a desire to maintain them) in the conduct of their public duties. In general larger donations have a greater potential to give rise to the perception of a conflict of interest. Conflict. Conflict arises where decisions are actually, potentially or perceived to be made against the public interest and/or duty as a result of private interests. In addition a conflict of interest exists if the donor is likely to receive a material benefit from a reasonably foreseeable decision that could be made by the Party or an elected Green, unless such benefit is likely to occur as a result of the donor being a member of such a broad class of beneficiary that their individual benefit is not readily identifiable or known or distinguishable from other members of that class. A conflict of interest also still exists where a donation is received from a third party or associated entity related to the individual or entity where the conflict of interest originates.","s":"Conflict of Interest:","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/24-donations-and-loans-not-from-financial-institutions/","h":"#conflict-of-interest","p":329},{"i":337,"t":"Action Body Date Approved State Executive 2007-05-10 Amended State Executive 2009-05-28 Amended State Council 2013-05-04 Amended State Executive 2013-06-20 Amended State Executive 2013-07-14 Amended State Council 2015-07-25","s":"Modification History","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/24-donations-and-loans-not-from-financial-institutions/","h":"#modification-history","p":329},{"i":339,"t":"On this page","s":"Travel and Reimbursement","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/25-travel-and-reimbursement/","h":"","p":338},{"i":341,"t":"Members and supporters are entitled to be fully reimbursed for any authorised expenditure made in the course of their duties for the Party where:# such expenditure has been budgeted for# such expenditure has been authorised.# Expenditure can only be authorised by:# Bodies properly constituted by or under the Constitution of the Australian Greens – Victoria “with an agreed budget of their own.# The Most Senior Staff MemberState Director.# The state-wide Campaign Manager (where appointed) for campaign related expenditure.# Expenditure to be reimbursed must appear in the budget for the authorising body.# All expenditure to be reimbursed must be minuted in the minutes of the authorising body except where such expenditure is authorised by the Most Senior Staff MemberState Director in line with their delegated limits.# Minutes used to support or authorise expenditure should include:# the decision to authorise the expenditure# the decision to make the reimbursement, when it occurs,# attached copies of supporting documentation and# such other information as the AGVAustralian Greens Victoria’s Most Senior Staff MemberState Director may reasonably require.# Reimbursement of expenditure can only occur where the relevant supporting documentation is provided.# Relevant supporting documentation includes, but is not limited to: invoices, receipts, tickets, vehicle logs, signed and witnessed Statutory Declarations.# Liability for reimbursement will not extend beyond the body that authorised the expenditure except at the discretion of the AGVAustralian Greens Victoria Treasurer.# Reimbursement for authorised expenses will be made within 30 days of the supporting documentation being presented to the relevant Party body where all the conditions above have been met.

Version as at [date approved by Consumer Affairs Victoria] Drafting Panel commentary Overview The constitution of a political partya political party registered under Commonwealth, state or territory law is its key governance document. An organisation consists of different people who will want different things and have different views. The constitution tells us how the members have decided that decisions will be made, how power is distributed and exercised, and who gets to decide what. Most people will agree that our Constitution needs to be both democratic – reflecting in some way the views of the membership – and effective – capable of giving effect to its objectives. Below is a thematic explanation of what is proposed. Where important, clauses are mentioned. The key elements of the proposed new structure are: A new State Council of 15 members elected by proportional representation by all members.# Branches with – in practice – a largely unchanged role, but with the capacity to determine their own internal administrative structure.# Mandatory participatory and deliberative processes for members to establish policies and the party strategy.# Regular all-member forums.# Mandatory and specific affirmative action provisions, and a guaranteed right of participation for First Nations members at the top level of the Partythe incorporated association referred to in clause 40(1).# A much shorter and simpler document than we have now, leaving much more for party bodies and members to determine as needs arise.# A system under which members who are unhappy with a decision (or non- decision) by the State Council can, through their branches, initiate a discussion of that issue involving all members, aimed at developing consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so, and in certain circumstances having the issue resolved by a vote of all members.# A Constitutional Votes Committee responsible for the integrity of elections and for member votes under the Constitution.#","s":"index","u":"/agvrules/new-constitution/","h":"","p":857},{"i":860,"t":"On this page","s":"COUNTRY GREENS NETWORK TERMS OF REFERENCE","u":"/agvrules/terms-of-reference/country-greens/","h":"","p":859},{"i":862,"t":"To establish and build a network of Greens party members of the Northern, Western and Eastern Victoria Upper House regions.","s":"PURPOSE","u":"/agvrules/terms-of-reference/country-greens/","h":"#purpose","p":859},{"i":864,"t":"To facilitate and properly resource party building in each of the country Upper House regions;# To foster a supportive environment for the pre-selection of candidates in all country seats in Victoria;# To establish a forum for policy discussion and development with regard to interests, perspectives and issues relevant to people living in country Victoria;# To seek representation of those interests, perspectives and issues in the Greens party platform;# To establish a public presence in rural areas and regional centres that will allow country Victorians to engage with the Greens;# To establish a coordinated media and public presence in country Victoria consistent with A.G.V. media guidelines;# To set up I.T. infrastructure and support (website portal, bulletin boards, e lists etc) that facilitates networking across the rural Upper House regions, recognizing the connectivity constraints of country Victoria;# To resource continuous campaigning in each of the rural Upper House regions;# To provide a conduit between country Victorians and Green MPs.#","s":"AIMS","u":"/agvrules/terms-of-reference/country-greens/","h":"#aims","p":859},{"i":866,"t":"The Network will be underpinned by the values evident in the Victorian Greens constitution, and meeting protocol.","s":"VALUES","u":"/agvrules/terms-of-reference/country-greens/","h":"#values","p":859},{"i":868,"t":"Ongoing network","s":"DURATION","u":"/agvrules/terms-of-reference/country-greens/","h":"#duration","p":859},{"i":870,"t":"The Country Greens Network is a loose network of all AGVAustralian Greens Victoria members residing in the rural Upper House regions with an Executive Committee comprising: A representative from each branch in the rural Upper House regions elected by that branch, if the branch chooses to elect a representative;# The representative to the Australian Greens Country Greens Working Group elected by the Committee from amongst all AGVAustralian Greens Victoria members residing in the rural Upper House regions; and# A convenor, an IT officer, and a Secretary elected by the Committee from its membership, or external.
