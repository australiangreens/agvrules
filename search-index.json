A simple majority is required for the procedural question to be agreed to, with the exception of the procedural questions to put a proposal to a vote or to suspend Standing Orders, which require a 75% super majority for the procedural question to be agreed to.# Procedural questions will only take the form of one of the following phrases or of those referred to elsewhere in these Standing Orders:# “that time for discussion on the Proposal now expire”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the facilitator to immediately test for consensus on the Proposal, that is, to end any discussion immediately.# It should not be used in an attempt to silence dissent, and generally should only be used if the time allotted to debate is nearing its end.# “that the Proposal be considered at a later time this day”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the State Secretary to schedule time later in the day for further consideration of the Proposal at hand.# ⌛This clause comes into force on 1 February 2022. “that the Proposal be considered at the next meeting”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the State Secretary to include the Proposal, in its exact form, on the agenda for the next State Council meeting.# ⌛This clause comes into force on 1 February 2022. “that the matter be considered at the next meeting”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the State Secretary to schedule time on the agenda for the next State Council meeting for debate on the substantive matter at hand, but allows flexibility for the redrafting of any Proposals.# “that the Proposal lapse”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to defeat, rather than defer, a Proposal, without first testing for consensus. It should only be put if it has become apparent that a decision on the matter is not required.# “that Proposal [number] be now considered”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to consider a Proposal in a different order to that stated on the agenda.# “that the Proposal be put to a vote”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to put the Proposal at hand to a vote.# It should only be put for the reasons stated in the State Constitution; that is, that “if, after a reasonable period of time, disagreement persists and a decision cannot be deferred, the question will be resolved by vote.”# 48.2: Except where this Constitution requires a decision to be made by consensus only, if, after a reasonable period of time, disagreement persists and a decision should not be deferred, the question of moving to a vote on a substantive motion will be resolved by vote. The procedural question to this effect will be deemed to have been carried if it is supported by at least a 75 per cent majority. “that the names and votes of State Councillors voting be recorded”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is for the names of those State Councillors voting for, against, or abstaining from the previous Proposal, to be recorded in the minutes.# The procedural question must be put within five minutes of the facilitator declaring the outcome of the Proposal in question.# In the event that the list of names by vote type contradicts the total recorded in the minutes, the totals will be amended to reflect the list.# “that a Proposal regarding [very short description of substance of proposal] be considered”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is for State Council to consider a Proposal that did not appear on the agenda.# “that consideration of this agenda item be extended for [number] minutes”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to extend time for discussion beyond the time allowed for in the agenda.# “that the words ‘For report only’ be removed from the agenda”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to open discussion at a time when the agenda does not allow for open discussion (see Standing Orders: Discussion).# In all but the most important of cases, State Councillors should only seek to have the words “For report only” removed from parts of the agenda at the beginning of the meeting.# “that the ruling of the facilitator be overturned”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to overturn the facilitator’s most recent ruling on a procedural matter.# It must only be raised in the most serious of cases.# “that the facilitator step down”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the facilitator to step down, and for the State Convenor to choose another facilitator.# It must only be raised in the most serious of cases.# “that [Name] cease raising procedural questions”# ❗This power must not be delegated. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to disallow any one State Councillor from raising procedural questions for the rest of the meeting.# It must only be raised in the most serious of cases.# “that the standing orders be suspended for [number] minutes to allow for [details of matter]”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to suspend the standing orders for a determined amount of time.# “that the meeting go in camera to discuss [details of matter]” and, if necessary, “and that [observers’ names] be permitted to stay due to [short rationale]”# The effect of this procedural question being agreed is for the meeting to go in camera and, if necessary, for certain observers to be permitted to stay.# This procedural question should only be raised when absolutely necessary.# Procedural questions will be minuted consistently as follows:# A procedural question, “that [text of question]”, was [not] agreed to. Unlike for the recording of the outcomes of Proposals, if procedural questions are put to a vote by show of hands, votes, including abstentions, are not recorded in the minutes.#","s":"Procedural questions","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/18-standing-orders-of-state-council/","h":"#procedural-questions","p":255},{"i":274,"t":"As far as reasonably practicable items listed for Discussion should fall into two categories:# Items listed for short discussion, which generally should be:# very limited in number;# limited to 10 minutes duration; and# either uncontroversial (e.g. a motion of thanks, which it would be inappropriate to put through without consideration) or necessary (e.g. because the information on which a recommendation could be based could only be available at the last minute, such as legal advice or a cost-quote, but where the matter was otherwise uncontroversial).# Items listed for full discussion, which should generally:# be no more than 3 or 4 in number;# be given a minimum of one hour each on the Agenda, or a workshop plus at least half an hour; and# as far as practicable, contain a brief summary of:# the history of the matter;# the contending views.

Public duty. It is the duty of members of The Greens to uphold the Greens Charter and promote our policies. It is the public duty of elected representatives and other officials of The Greens to represent their constituents impartially and act without undue influence in the community interest. Private interests. Candidates, elected representatives and other officials of The Greens are the beneficiaries of political donations directly or to the Party and hence have a private interest in those donations. They could be, or could be reasonably perceived to be, influenced by donations (and a desire to maintain them) in the conduct of their public duties. In general larger donations have a greater potential to give rise to the perception of a conflict of interest. Conflict. Conflict arises where decisions are actually, potentially or perceived to be made against the public interest and/or duty as a result of private interests. In addition a conflict of interest exists if the donor is likely to receive a material benefit from a reasonably foreseeable decision that could be made by the Party or an elected Green, unless such benefit is likely to occur as a result of the donor being a member of such a broad class of beneficiary that their individual benefit is not readily identifiable or known or distinguishable from other members of that class.
