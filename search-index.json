Public duty. It is the duty of members of The Greens to uphold the Greens Charter and promote our policies. It is the public duty of elected representatives and other officials of The Greens to represent their constituents impartially and act without undue influence in the community interest. Private interests. Candidates, elected representatives and other officials of The Greens are the beneficiaries of political donations directly or to the Party and hence have a private interest in those donations. They could be, or could be reasonably perceived to be, influenced by donations (and a desire to maintain them) in the conduct of their public duties. In general larger donations have a greater potential to give rise to the perception of a conflict of interest. Conflict. Conflict arises where decisions are actually, potentially or perceived to be made against the public interest and/or duty as a result of private interests. In addition a conflict of interest exists if the donor is likely to receive a material benefit from a reasonably foreseeable decision that could be made by the Party or an elected Green, unless such benefit is likely to occur as a result of the donor being a member of such a broad class of beneficiary that their individual benefit is not readily identifiable or known or distinguishable from other members of that class. A conflict of interest also still exists where a donation is received from a third party or associated entity related to the individual or entity where the conflict of interest originates.","s":"Conflict of Interest:","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/24-donations-and-loans-not-from-financial-institutions/","h":"#conflict-of-interest","p":353},{"i":361,"t":"Action Body Date Approved State Executive 2007-05-10 Amended State Executive 2009-05-28 Amended State Council 2013-05-04 Amended State Executive 2013-06-20 Amended State Executive 2013-07-14 Amended State Council 2015-07-25","s":"Modification History","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/24-donations-and-loans-not-from-financial-institutions/","h":"#modification-history","p":353},{"i":363,"t":"On this page","s":"Mutual Responsibilities Between Elected Representatives and Party Bodies, Officers and Members","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/27-mutual-responsibilities-between-elected-representatives-and-party-bodies-officers-and-members/","h":"","p":362},{"i":365,"t":"The reporting arrangements need not be mechanical or prescriptive, but must ensure that:# in the case of public office-holders, the relevant bodies are provided with a verbal report (default) or written report (if attendance is not possible), which should aim to cover:# main activities undertaken;# key decisions made as a public office-holder;# major issues which are pending;# the planned approach to these issues; and# issues in which they are involved where their position is likely to involve considerable public controversy or are likely to be controversial within the Party.
