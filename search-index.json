Public duty. It is the duty of members of The Greens to uphold the Greens Charter and promote our policies. It is the public duty of elected representatives and other officials of The Greens to represent their constituents impartially and act without undue influence in the community interest. Private interests. Candidates, elected representatives and other officials of The Greens are the beneficiaries of political donations directly or to the Party and hence have a private interest in those donations. They could be, or could be reasonably perceived to be, influenced by donations (and a desire to maintain them) in the conduct of their public duties. In general larger donations have a greater potential to give rise to the perception of a conflict of interest. Conflict. Conflict arises where decisions are actually, potentially or perceived to be made against the public interest and/or duty as a result of private interests. In addition a conflict of interest exists if the donor is likely to receive a material benefit from a reasonably foreseeable decision that could be made by the Party or an elected Green, unless such benefit is likely to occur as a result of the donor being a member of such a broad class of beneficiary that their individual benefit is not readily identifiable or known or distinguishable from other members of that class.

Below is a thematic explanation of what is proposed. Where important, clauses are mentioned. The key elements of the proposed new structure are: A new State Council of 15 members elected by proportional representation by all members.# Branches with – in practice – a largely unchanged role, but with the capacity to determine their own internal administrative structure.# Mandatory participatory and deliberative processes for members to establish policies and the party strategy.# Regular all-member forums.# Mandatory and specific affirmative action provisions, and a guaranteed right of participation for First Nations members at the top level of the Partythe incorporated association referred to in clause 40(1).# A much shorter and simpler document than we have now, leaving much more for party bodies and members to determine as needs arise.# A system under which members who are unhappy with a decision (or non- decision) by the State Council can, through their branches, initiate a discussion of that issue involving all members, aimed at developing consensusthe circumstance in which no member of the party body who is in attendance objects to the proposal being passed, having been given the opportunity to do so, and in certain circumstances having the issue resolved by a vote of all members.# A Constitutional Votes Committee responsible for the integrity of elections and for member votes under the Constitution.#","s":"index","u":"/agvrules/proposed-constitution/","h":"","p":430},{"i":433,"t":"On this page","s":"Tithing","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/31-tithing/","h":"","p":432},{"i":435,"t":"Action Body Date Approved State Executive 2009-04-09 Amended State Executive 2010-10-14 Amended State Executive 2011-11-24 Amended State Executive 2018-01-18 Amended State Executive 2019-09-19","s":"Modification History","u":"/agvrules/bylaws/31-tithing/","h":"#modification-history","p":432},{"i":437,"t":"Acknowledgement of Country The Australian Greens Victoria: Acknowledges First Nations peoples as the custodians of Country.
